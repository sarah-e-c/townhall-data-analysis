Cassidy Moulton-Hill ,Protect Kids,This attempt to keep trans children from affirming their gender in the most vulnerable place they can be is a clear disregard for children’s lives and an attempt at nothing but conveying control over children with an extremely partisan belief. Trans children are more likely to commit suicide over cis children. To declare any type of protection for children and then disregarding their right to be and simply just use a bathroom (a place that should be of extremely little concern of adults) makes the original argument disingenuous at best. Protect children by allowing them the respect to make decisions regarding their own mental health and their decision to choose where to mind their own business without adults obsessing over their genitalia.,128948,9/26/22  12:30am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128948
"LH, Fairfax County Public Schools mother ",Wholly support the 2022 guidance,"I fully support the proposed 2022 Guidelines.  The 2021 Guidance put schools in the position of severing the parent-child relationship, of deciding what is best for a child and of unduly influencing a minor child.  While supportive schools are essential, and the rights of every student are equally important, parents know, love and care for their children far more than schools, which are transient in a child's life.  The previous 2021 guidance went far beyond State and Federal Law in wresting decision-making and authority away from parents and handing it over to schools and non-guardians.   This new guidance appropriately revokes the deceit authorized by the 2021 guidance, which in practice directed schools to conceal its interactions with a minor child, whether over counseling or use of pronouns, facilities etc. This deceitful aspect of the 2021 guidance was one of its most problematic and dangerous features. The previous guidance also cited and relied on resources only from ideological groups and smaller committees of medical professionals.  There is growing evidence, internationally and nationally, of harm from rushing children to gender transition, and the previous guidance fostered this by its complete omission of full research.  Most countries in Europe are moving away from the gender-affirming only approach, because of the accumulating evidence of harm to children.  Schools should never take on the role of influencing a child's sexuality or gender identity, and the previous guidance put schools in this position by an entirely one-sided approach to gender, rather than a balanced one as would be true of an evidence-based approach.   Additionally, the previous guidance put girls and women in harm's way by allowing males into all their safe spaces.  While the intent of the 2021 guidance is to allow transgender students to chose facilities, the practice in the way it is worded disallows questioning of any male entering a female space.  Further, the population of girls and women who have been victims of sexual assault is far greater than the population of transgender students, and it is wrong and dangerous for these women to have to fear males entering private spaces with them. There are reasonable and fair ways to protect transgender students without taking away the right to privacy and safety of every female in the system. Further, the former guidance unlawfully compelled speech as to pronoun usage, again going far beyond both State and federal law.  Every child deserves equal respect, but the law does not grant them the right to compel the speech of others. Every school will have to work out ways to respect and support transgender children, including for children who may face danger at home. It goes without question that support, compassion and respect are essential to caring for transgender children in schools. The answer, however, is not a blanket order affecting all families by unlawfully removing parental authority and involvement from a child's life, as was the effect of the previous guidance.  Schools and counselors should be partners with children and parents, not usurpers of parental roles. This policy is a great step forward in removing the excesses of the 2021 Guidance.",128949,9/26/22  2:37am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128949

Deb F ,Protect Kids,"Names matter and every kid deserves to be called by their chosen name without question. I moved to VA in the middle of kindergarten. My new teacher was an old bat named Mrs. Vannoy who insisted that all children be called by their proper names. My proper name was Deborah and despite my parents telling her that I went by Debbie, she refused to call me by that name. To this day, I still cringe a little when I hear people use it because I grew to hate my own name by a teacher who wouldn't listen. Furthermore, I knew how to spell Debbie but not Deborah so imagine being a kid in school who doesn't know how to spell your own name. As a teacher, I have kids that go by many names that aren't their own given name. Being a Southerner, most of my family goes by either a nickname or some other name like a middle name. I have friends who I don't know their real names because I've always known them by a nickname. NO ONE QUESTIONS THIS and they shouldn't. But if one day, if Amy wants to be known as Aiden or Michael wants to go by Chelle, it's suddenly harmful to the child - to use a name they chose. We need to stop this nonsense and use the money creating these bigoted bills (and the ensuing lawsuits) to do something really useful like give school staff raises, purchase school supplies, and fix crumbling school infrastructure.",128955,9/26/22  6:48am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128955

Parent nova ,100% support parental rights ,"100% yes. It is unlawful for Schools to take away parental rights. The high suicide rates with the transgender community are not because of the parents But rather because of the system failing a child, allowing the child to cut off their genitalia, and pursue a sex change at a very young age before the child has the sense that it is forever changing their future. Once the child realizes that they were pressured into an unalterable sex change, they will clearly be angry at the school system, their community, and their parents for failing them. A girl who has her breasts removed will never be able to nurse her children, and also worse may never be able to have children after the surgery. The fact that parents would not be involved in something so significant is criminal. This of course needs to change because parents to have rights despite what the school boards are pushing.",128957,9/26/22  6:54am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128957

No.  Bathrooms are a non-issue as well. Kids don't even get bathroom breaks these days anyway because schools are too concerned about vaping and fights. Stop this nonsense and tell parents if they want to be more involved in their kid's lives, they need to BE A PARENT and not demand that the schools do everything for them. They also need to spend time with their kids instead of yelling at school board meetings or complaining that teachers never tell them anything even though their kid has dozens of crumpled up notes from their teacher buried in their backpack.",128958,9/26/22  7:01am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128958

It hurts no one to call a child by their chosen name. As an early childhood educator, I learned whole school fulls of children's names, and some gasp were nicknames or even middle names.  It’s no longer acceptable to cram people into the box some small mind thinks they fit into, regardless of who they actually are, until they succumb to depression or anxiety or descend to the point of suicide. Every kid deserves a chance to reach their full potential, and for that to happen, they all need to feel equally safe in school.",128959,9/26/22  7:01am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128959

They should not be held responsible for remembering what someone chooses to be called. Parents need to be more active in these important decisions as that is their responsibility as a parent! Letting children choose encourages more ridiculousness like identifying as a cat or dog and this IS happening also. Where do we draw the line. When they leave the education system they can be whatever they choose but as long as they are under 18 parents are the deciding factor and let’s hope they have the good sense to be a sensible guidance to their child. ",128965,9/26/22  7:18am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128965

It seems all attention is being paid to leftist political theories, rather than academic rigor, and the failing performance of our schools, is evidence to this fact.

Gay Rights Activist and Parent ,U.S. History and the Virginia Code and Rule of Law Affirms Parental Rights,"I have been an active supporter of gay rights for over a decade and sat on a national board that helped to over turn ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" established by U.S. President Bill Clinton.  I also worked tirelessly to support civil marriage for all consenting adults. These were monumental changes in our society that made us a better nation.  That said, the current movement by educators and some politicians who are not board certified in mental health, gender dysphoria, and pediatric medicine is profoundly disturbing, unethical, and akin to medical malpractice.  There is a bright line between adult decisions and parental rights and the law in Virginia is quite clear and is based on thousands of years of culture and human history writ large: § 1-240.1. Rights of parents. A parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent's child.  The attempt by some to separate parents from their minor children is chilling and dangerous.  It is what Stalin attempted to do in the Soviet Union, Pol Pot did in Cambodia, and what the Chinese Communist Party is current doing to the  Uyghur children. Educators and politicians who want to separate minor children claim parents will abuse or harm children who may have gender dysphoria. Every educator and person who works with minor children is legally responsible to be a mandatory reporter so that all children are safe. Mandatory reporters are not to keep secrets with minor children from their parents.  If they suspect abuse they must immediately report that claim to law enforcement. There are laws on the books and training for all mandatory reporters to go to law enforcement so this argument is moot.  Think about this for a moment - how would you feel if a teacher gave razor blades to a minor child who is cutting themselves to ""affirm"" their affliction?  Or if a teacher helped an anorexic girl get fat removed from her body to ""affirm"" her affliction?  Affirming any mental health crisis without being board certified and without parental permission is caustic and destructive behavior.  It is insanity.  A child in Virginia schools cannot take an Tylenol without parental consent and yet some elected officials want to put the burden on educators to be a board certified medical professional. That is not only unethical it is illegal. To that end, this policy makes sense.  Removing parents from their legal responsibility to make decisions for their minor child by the school system is illegal and morally reprehensible.  This policy is on solid legal and moral footing and reaffirms parental rights in Virginia while supporting all children and ensuring educators are reminded they are educators and not medical professionals.  ",,9/26/22  8:08am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128988

Anonymous ,Strongly Oppose The Changes ,"Correct pronoun and name use is incredibly critical to the mental and physical health of transgender students. The proposed changes to this law threaten that health and safety, by only allowing students who feel comfortable sharing their gender identity with their parents the right of being treated with the respect of their correct name and pronouns. There are hundreds of reasons a child might not feel comfortable sharing this with their parents - religion, politics, or even just not being ready to share with their family yet. The argument that parents have the right to raise their children themselves is nonsensical, as it implied that teachers are somehow forcing a gender identity onto trans kids by respecting their pronouns. Moreover, children request to be called different names than their legal name all the time. Will we need parental consent to call William Will, or to call someone who prefers their middle name by it? This proposed change unfairly targets transgender children, and will have dire consequences for their health and wellbeing in schools if enacted.   ",128992,9/26/22  8:12am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128992
Tracey Marek ,strongly oppose this policy,"Having worked with students in both middle and high schools in Virginia for 26 years this policy will only cause damage.

The previous policies PROTECTED all students, this new policy targets transgender youth in a very negative way. We already have a mental health crisis in youth and now you want us to obtain written statements from parents telling us what name to use for their children? Do you not understand that most of these children are NOT out to their parents yet for fear of abuse, disownment, harassment etc.? This is not a whim or choice, only about 2% of transgender students ever change back to cisgender.

Anonymous ,Opposition to new transgender policy,"I strongly oppose the new transgender policy. The policy purports to be aimed at supporting parental rights. However, it actually makes it harder and more burdensome for parents to support their children who already are dealing with tough issues by unrealistically and unnecessarily requiring them to provide legal documents to support use of different pronouns for their child. Further the policy requiring students to use the bathrooms that correspond to their gender assigned at birth is harmful mentally and physically to students. The department’s policies should be about its STUDENTS and their well-being. Instead the new policy is about a politician scoring points with a constituency.

Cassidy Moulton-Hill ,Protect Kids,This attempt to keep trans children from affirming their gender in the most vulnerable place they can be is a clear disregard for children’s lives and an attempt at nothing but conveying control over children with an extremely partisan belief. Trans children are more likely to commit suicide over cis children. To declare any type of protection for children and then disregarding their right to be and simply just use a bathroom (a place that should be of extremely little concern of adults) makes the original argument disingenuous at best. Protect children by allowing them the respect to make decisions regarding their own mental health and their decision to choose where to mind their own business without adults obsessing over their genitalia.,128948,9/26/22  12:30am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128948
"LH, Fairfax County Public Schools mother ",Wholly support the 2022 guidance,"I fully support the proposed 2022 Guidelines.  The 2021 Guidance put schools in the position of severing the parent-child relationship, of deciding what is best for a child and of unduly influencing a minor child.  While supportive schools are essential, and the rights of every student are equally important, parents know, love and care for their children far more than schools, which are transient in a child's life.  The previous 2021 guidance went far beyond State and Federal Law in wresting decision-making and authority away from parents and handing it over to schools and non-guardians.   This new guidance appropriately revokes the deceit authorized by the 2021 guidance, which in practice directed schools to conceal its interactions with a minor child, whether over counseling or use of pronouns, facilities etc. This deceitful aspect of the 2021 guidance was one of its most problematic and dangerous features. The previous guidance also cited and relied on resources only from ideological groups and smaller committees of medical professionals.  There is growing evidence, internationally and nationally, of harm from rushing children to gender transition, and the previous guidance fostered this by its complete omission of full research.  Most countries in Europe are moving away from the gender-affirming only approach, because of the accumulating evidence of harm to children.  Schools should never take on the role of influencing a child's sexuality or gender identity, and the previous guidance put schools in this position by an entirely one-sided approach to gender, rather than a balanced one as would be true of an evidence-based approach.   Additionally, the previous guidance put girls and women in harm's way by allowing males into all their safe spaces.  While the intent of the 2021 guidance is to allow transgender students to chose facilities, the practice in the way it is worded disallows questioning of any male entering a female space.  Further, the population of girls and women who have been victims of sexual assault is far greater than the population of transgender students, and it is wrong and dangerous for these women to have to fear males entering private spaces with them. There are reasonable and fair ways to protect transgender students without taking away the right to privacy and safety of every female in the system. Further, the former guidance unlawfully compelled speech as to pronoun usage, again going far beyond both State and federal law.  Every child deserves equal respect, but the law does not grant them the right to compel the speech of others. Every school will have to work out ways to respect and support transgender children, including for children who may face danger at home. It goes without question that support, compassion and respect are essential to caring for transgender children in schools. The answer, however, is not a blanket order affecting all families by unlawfully removing parental authority and involvement from a child's life, as was the effect of the previous guidance.  Schools and counselors should be partners with children and parents, not usurpers of parental roles. This policy is a great step forward in removing the excesses of the 2021 Guidance.",128949,9/26/22  2:37am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128949

Deb F ,Protect Kids,"Names matter and every kid deserves to be called by their chosen name without question. I moved to VA in the middle of kindergarten. My new teacher was an old bat named Mrs. Vannoy who insisted that all children be called by their proper names. My proper name was Deborah and despite my parents telling her that I went by Debbie, she refused to call me by that name. To this day, I still cringe a little when I hear people use it because I grew to hate my own name by a teacher who wouldn't listen. Furthermore, I knew how to spell Debbie but not Deborah so imagine being a kid in school who doesn't know how to spell your own name. As a teacher, I have kids that go by many names that aren't their own given name. Being a Southerner, most of my family goes by either a nickname or some other name like a middle name. I have friends who I don't know their real names because I've always known them by a nickname. NO ONE QUESTIONS THIS and they shouldn't. But if one day, if Amy wants to be known as Aiden or Michael wants to go by Chelle, it's suddenly harmful to the child - to use a name they chose. We need to stop this nonsense and use the money creating these bigoted bills (and the ensuing lawsuits) to do something really useful like give school staff raises, purchase school supplies, and fix crumbling school infrastructure.",128955,9/26/22  6:48am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128955

The high suicide rates with the transgender community are not because of the parents But rather because of the system failing a child, allowing the child to cut off their genitalia, and pursue a sex change at a very young age before the child has the sense that it is forever changing their future. Once the child realizes that they were pressured into an unalterable sex change, they will clearly be angry at the school system, their community, and their parents for failing them. A girl who has her breasts removed will never be able to nurse her children, and also worse may never be able to have children after the surgery. The fact that parents would not be involved in something so significant is criminal.

Gay Rights Activist and Parent ,U.S. History and the Virginia Code and Rule of Law Affirms Parental Rights,"I have been an active supporter of gay rights for over a decade and sat on a national board that helped to over turn ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" established by U.S. President Bill Clinton.  I also worked tirelessly to support civil marriage for all consenting adults. These were monumental changes in our society that made us a better nation.  That said, the current movement by educators and some politicians who are not board certified in mental health, gender dysphoria, and pediatric medicine is profoundly disturbing, unethical, and akin to medical malpractice.  There is a bright line between adult decisions and parental rights and the law in Virginia is quite clear and is based on thousands of years of culture and human history writ large: § 1-240.1. Rights of parents. A parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent's child.  The attempt by some to separate parents from their minor children is chilling and dangerous.  It is what Stalin attempted to do in the Soviet Union, Pol Pot did in Cambodia, and what the Chinese Communist Party is current doing to the  Uyghur children. Educators and politicians who want to separate minor children claim parents will abuse or harm children who may have gender dysphoria. Every educator and person who works with minor children is legally responsible to be a mandatory reporter so that all children are safe. Mandatory reporters are not to keep secrets with minor children from their parents.  If they suspect abuse they must immediately report that claim to law enforcement. There are laws on the books and training for all mandatory reporters to go to law enforcement so this argument is moot.  Think about this for a moment - how would you feel if a teacher gave razor blades to a minor child who is cutting themselves to ""affirm"" their affliction?  Or if a teacher helped an anorexic girl get fat removed from her body to ""affirm"" her affliction?  Affirming any mental health crisis without being board certified and without parental permission is caustic and destructive behavior.  It is insanity.  A child in Virginia schools cannot take an Tylenol without parental consent and yet some elected officials want to put the burden on educators to be a board certified medical professional. That is not only unethical it is illegal. To that end, this policy makes sense.  Removing parents from their legal responsibility to make decisions for their minor child by the school system is illegal and morally reprehensible.  This policy is on solid legal and moral footing and reaffirms parental rights in Virginia while supporting all children and ensuring educators are reminded they are educators and not medical professionals.  ",,9/26/22  8:08am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128988

Anonymous ,Strongly Oppose The Changes ,"Correct pronoun and name use is incredibly critical to the mental and physical health of transgender students. The proposed changes to this law threaten that health and safety, by only allowing students who feel comfortable sharing their gender identity with their parents the right of being treated with the respect of their correct name and pronouns. There are hundreds of reasons a child might not feel comfortable sharing this with their parents - religion, politics, or even just not being ready to share with their family yet. The argument that parents have the right to raise their children themselves is nonsensical, as it implied that teachers are somehow forcing a gender identity onto trans kids by respecting their pronouns. Moreover, children request to be called different names than their legal name all the time. Will we need parental consent to call William Will, or to call someone who prefers their middle name by it?

However, it actually makes it harder and more burdensome for parents to support their children who already are dealing with tough issues by unrealistically and unnecessarily requiring them to provide legal documents to support use of different pronouns for their child. Further the policy requiring students to use the bathrooms that correspond to their gender assigned at birth is harmful mentally and physically to students. The department’s policies should be about its STUDENTS and their well-being. Instead the new policy is about a politician scoring points with a constituency. This is cruel and will have detrimental consequences for children—all we should care about. ",128994,9/26/22  8:13am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128994

Christopher Meade ,I oppose this policy,"I am strongly against this attack on transgender people. If a student prefers to be called by a nick name in school, there is no problem (my name is Christopher but I preferred Chris and my teachers accommodated this). Calling a student by there preferred name is just basic respect and that should include trans students.    Also, outing transgender students can lead to violence/abuse against them and can impact their mental health which could lead to self harm and suicide.    Trans students should feel safe to be themselves just like every other student. This policy is blatant discrimination and, on a practical note, will be almost impossible to enforce. I know several teachers who have said they fully intend to ignore this policy when it is passed. Its nothing more than a ridiculous political stunt meant to appease the worst parts of the republican base.

Anonymous ,Protecting the emotional support offered to all students.,"Each student is entitled to emotional support from the school district they attend.  Ignoring the rights of transgender students is detrimental to their social and emotional growth as a young person.  By supporting the existing law concerning these rights, students can continue to grow in their journey to adulthood with the help of a caring and supportive school environment. In situations where students families do not accept or are not comfortable with their child’s decisions, perhaps resources can be made available to help them on their journey to learn more about the topic and how it applies to their situation. Threatening to kick a child out of the house or refusing to pay for college is certainly not helpful. The link between school and home is strong and anything to help bridge the transition to accepting a child’s transgender journey should be explored. Above all, protecting the student’s emotional well being must be a priority. Changing the existing law does not achieve that goal. ",129002,9/26/22  8:29am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129002

Especially people who have never talked to transgender kids or families of transgender kids,read the actual data from the America Academy of Pediatrics or just felt like most parents want what is best for their kids. My kid is not a political stand; my kid is not trying to pollute, groom, or corrupt your child. My child wants to go to school, use the bathroom and not be harassed regularly for who he is. Where are my parental rights in this policy? Where are my child’s rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? Policies such as this will end the lives of transgender children. It will put a group already at risk into more danger. Additionally, there isn’t a magic wand of declaring a minor is transgender and immediately that child is “mutilated”. The transition period with medical intervention is not immediate or done lightly. No parent I know has taken medical transition lightly. We are not stupid. We want to do what is best for OUR kid and do what keeps them ALIVE. Sometimes those decisions lead to surgery sometimes not. Some transgender people NEVER even want surgery. There is not a one size fits all to being trans. This policy is a direct reaction to fear and misunderstanding and willful ignorance and intentional fear mongering. It is wrong. It is judgement without basis in fact. Furthermore, go to a typical public school. You will not see trans kids taking over or teachers shoving gender issues down anyone’s throat. Teachers have enough on their plates and simply (most) just want their students to succeed no matter their gender.

 Counselor ,Strongly OPPOSE ,"September 26, 2022 The Virginia School Counselor Association (VSCA) opposes the Virginia Department of Education’s 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools as they are currently proposed. The 2022 model policies create barriers to privacy, dignity, and respect for Virginia’s students and seek to undermine previous legislation (i.e., § 22.1-23.3. Treatment of transgender students; policies) that works to create safe and supportive environments for our most vulnerable youth.  VSCA recognizes that: 56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020). Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for transgender males and 149% for transgender females (Murchison et al., 2019). 28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020). Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked out or abused (Thoma, 2021). Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022). Virginia school counselors work to remove barriers and support the social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. VSCA Ends Policies state that “Virginia School Counselors are committed to working with and advocating for marginalized groups, promote the mental health and wellness of all students, adhere to the ASCA Ethical Standards for School Counselors, and actively work to dismantle destructive systemic inequities.” Additionally, Virginia school counselors follow the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Position Statement on The School Counselor and Transgender and Nonbinary Youth (Adopted 2016, revised 2022) that states:  School counselors work to safeguard the well-being of transgender and nonbinary youth. School counselors recognize all students have the right to be treated equally and fairly, with dignity and respect as unique individuals, free from discrimination, harassment and bullying based on their gender identity and gender expression. Finally, Virginia school counselors seek to create environments that are not only inclusive and equitable for all students, including our transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students, but that celebrate the full scope of their identities, allowing them to thrive and reach their fullest potential. Furthermore, Virginia school counselors commit to dismantling any and all forms of inequity in Virginia’s public education system and fully support LGBTQ+ students. Every Virginia student, regardless of their gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation, has a right to learn free from discrimination and harassment. Against this background, it is VSCA’s stance that the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools are empirically unfounded and are not in accordance with evidence-based best practices concerning the treatment of transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students.",,9/26/22  8:37am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129014

Eric Bonnell ,"Parents, not governmental institutions, raise children ","Political agenda has no place in the school. Parents have the responsibility and therefore the autonomy to choose what they see fit for their children to learn. Ethical and religious decisions are the parents to make. School administrators and teachers are meant to teach children the mechanics they need to understand the world and come to their own conclusions as the come of age. I am very glad that my child is past the school age and  not imposed upon by those with an agenda that bullies children into a single mindset that divides them against others. Diversity applies to all and the Constitution acknowledges that. The issues of slavery and gender are being discussed as if people today have caused the problem. When Fred Rogers was on television, he taught Diversity as a strength and not a dividing issue. Parents had the choice to turn off the television or change the channel  if they disagreed with his message. Parents should have the same power with the schools. Government has no place in these issues; public schools are failing because they are administered by people who are not true educators. True educators build up children for success and do not leverage them as pawns to push a political agenda. Anyone, regardless of political affiliation, who teaches children need to assess the appropriateness of topics for the developmental age of the children, with parental approval, and in areas where it is appropriate to bring a topic into the classroom, children should be given the spectrum of thought on the topic and work with their parents to decide their opinion on that topic. Teach diversity as a strength and teach children that they all have different traits that can be used for good if they work together. Teach children to appreciate differences of traits and opinions, and to use them to build a better world.",129037,9/26/22  8:52am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129037
L E Pugh ,What a piece of politically-motivated tripe,"Dear Virginia Department of Education , I just read your 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents in Virginia Public Schools. I must say, it seems to be misnamed. Nowhere in this document is the privacy, dignity, or respect of the student addressed. There is a lot of information on what rights parents have. There is a lot of “peers shouldn’t bully peers” and “this is what cyberbullying looks like”, but nowhere is there any consideration given to the student’s rights, dignity, or access to personal development/exploration. Your introduction says, “As a part of that work, educators strive to meet the individual needs of all students entrusted to their care, and teachers work to create educational environments where all students thrive. The Virginia Department of Education... recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students.” It should be followed up with “but we’re here to destroy this in the name of the parents.” Nowhere is there anything that addresses what to do when these things come into conflict. Nowhere is there any guidelines of what to do for conflict-resolution. Everything says, “the parent’s word goes,” which is stupid and naive. According to you, parents are gods and goddesses, since this document does not seriously consider the needs or mental health of the child. It doesn’t look into the issues transgender youth deal with. Students don’t usually thrive when their parents are controlling them at a distance. Parents aren’t mental health professionals, and shouldn’t be assumed to be such. Rarely, especially in middle and high school, do parents understand their kids. The teachers and counselors should be able to judge whether a situation is safe to raise the issue. It shouldn't be a blanket requirement. Few parents can talk freely with their kids about such sensitive sex/gender topics; mostly because they’ve made their opinions quite clear, and kids don’t want to deal with it, risk it, or disappoint their parents. Or because the parents don’t like talking about it, or can’t really discuss it short of throwing around religious slogans or trite phrases. Don’t assume the ideal situation is the reality. It rarely is. Also of note, is the noticeable lack of “transgender”-specific school-related content or anything that might show that you looked at the other side of the argument. Very few of the documents you quote address the specific concerns and problems faced by transgender youth. None of the Resources even address transgender specifically or exclusively. It’s almost like you don’t want to look at what you should be doing to help this community. None of your arguments talk about what happens when parents hurt their children with their intractability. None of your own explanation of the rules even mentions transgender youth problems. You don't address issues with suicide and depression. Since this involves that group of people, shouldn’t some text about it be included? You don’t even recognize a student as “transgender” unless their parent agrees with it. Which is a pretty big problem, since if parents agree with their children’s alignment or lack of it, there are not issues. Which “9,000+ comments submitted to the Department during the public comment period in 2021” did you look at? How many were from ticked off parents and religious leaders? Were any from the children themselves or their supporters? This whole thing is to justify a horrible rule that eliminates a vital support system, and undercuts the whole purpose of counseling. Therapists and counselors are not required to tell parents everything they talked about with the student/patient. Teachers often have that role too. Parents aren’t always the best determiners of what their child actually needs. They often are blinded by what they want their child to be, how they expect children of a certain sex to act, or how their own upbringing might make them think. If the 14th Amendment and parents’ rights are so overarching, why do we have CPS or any child-protection laws? Could it be that parents aren’t the perfect arbiters of morals that this document implies? If students are to be treated as individuals, so should parents. Making it a requirement to let parents know everything ignores the fact that the student (the person the school should be focused on, whom it is the school’s duty to partly raise) might not be able to talk to their parents about things. So, you’re saying, teachers can’t protect kids from their abusive parents. They can’t be confidantes or supporters that can help them without letting their parents know. They can’t use their best judgment in dealing with issues. Really? Why should a trained professional’s professional ethics and experience be superseded by a parent’s preference? I’d say most of this document frames this as a “religious rights” issue, which it isn’t. If parents’ religious beliefs can decide what a student learns in a public school (which affects a lot of non-believers), when will we stop teaching earth science, evolution, and the sun-centric solar system because it might tick off the creationists? We’re already removing real history because some parents object. We’ve killed most informative sex education because some parents disapprove. If the parents object so vehemently, maybe they should home-school or send them to religious schools. That is what the “parents right to determine education” really means. When did we stop listening to people who actually studied education? The minute you contact “social services” for suicidal trans or gay kids with abusive parents, guess what? The parents are informed, which is what the kids don’t need. According to you, the parents should be able to raise their kids how they want… so guess what the social services is likely to do? Defer to the parents. There needs to be a middle ground, based on circumstances. There needs to be some way a kid can get help from teachers or counselors privately. Because sometimes that help guides them to understand their parents and see what they might be missing. Making teachers etc. essentially informants removes that guidance, making the children suspicious, paranoid, and unwilling to ask for help. So, according to this guidance, teachers and school administrators can bully trans-kids. Peers can't. None of your high-sounding language about protecting kids from bullying takes into account that demanding they are called certain pronouns is bullying. It’s insisting they conform in a way that damages them psychologically. Same thing with dress codes. Even you admit that legally, gender dysphoria is a “disability”. That means accommodations must be made, and calling them a different pronoun or name is hardly “excessive” or “an undue burden”. That is the yardstick you’re supposed to use. Or are you trying to use the ableist argument that since they are “disabled” they can be controlled even more, that their needs should be ignored if their caregiver decides it? Which isn’t what that decision means, and directly contradicts Code of Virginia, § 2.2-3900, et seq., which you also quote. Honestly, the only thing I liked in this whole document was the suggested policy that required single-person bathrooms be available in reasonable numbers. I think Grimm v Glouchester and Williams v. Kincaid are the only times you mention transgender people in any sort of supportive way. Everything else defends parents and the rights of a teacher to offend and abuse the students. “Parent engagement in school” doesn’t mean they have veto power, and it doesn’t mean the students should be reported on. It means that when a parent forms a partnership with the teachers, when they take a positive active role in their kid’s learning, the kids react well. It shouldn’t mean they can get books banned arbitrarily. It doesn’t mean they are the captain of the ship either. “Parental engagement” also depends on the parent. Some parents are extremely toxic, not only to their kids, but the school, teachers, and community. But they should be given free rein to form policy and instruction? Few of the parents that want this ever engage with schools in a partnership way. They regard schools and teachers with suspicion. Nowhere are the wants and needs of the student even addressed. Nowhere is there any expectation of parents listening to or interacting with teachers in any way that isn’t dictatorial. Beyond a “partnership goal"". Where they officially have the right to “review and comment” on things like books and instruction, you give them the power to stop it all together. Laws meant to prevent the release of information, you take as proof that parents can do whatever they want. According to you they have total “control” over their kids. Which is pretty r/insaneparents actually. The statutes you quote about privacy say parents have the right to “review” and “alter” official records. In other words, no one else should be able to do that. That has nothing to do with what goes on in a classroom, how teachers/peers etc. address students. It has nothing to do with how the child refers to themselves. So why is this used to justify a parent having to officially agree to what their child is called by a teacher? A lot of the laws you quote are meant to prevent/do one thing, but you claim they do another. You expand their reach beyond their purview or twist what they mean to say. The mere fact that you do this proves that this is a document of ideology not real policy. And if schools or state institutions try to push ideology, that’s bad, right? Especially if it’s harmful to the students’ mental, emotional, and physical well-being. How do you not see how contradictory these three suggested policy items are? Or is this that ridiculous “you’re only transgender if your parents say you are” thing?: “1. Every effort should be made to ensure that a transgender student wishing to change his or her means of address is treated with respect, compassion, and dignity in the classroom and school environment. 2. [School Division] personnel shall refer to each student using only (i) the name that appears in the student’s official record, or (ii) if the student prefers, using any nickname commonly associated with the name that appears in the student’s official record. 3. [School Division] personnel shall refer to each student using only the pronouns appropriate to the sex appearing in the student’s official record — that is, male pronouns for a student whose legal sex is male, and female pronouns for a student whose legal sex is female. How is that showing respect, compassion or dignity to the student? So, basically, what your document is saying is “Schools shall respect all students” and “Schools shall serve all students” but not really. Because when what the student’s needs conflicts with the parent’s desires, “Schools shall defer to parents to make the best decisions with respect to their children”. No debate, no exceptions. Parents rule. Which is stupid and dangerous, as well as extremely contradictory with what you say elsewhere. You pay lip-service to caring about the children, but you don’t allow them to be themselves. You frame this as being reasonable, but it’s not. You offer excuse after excuse on why you are “obligated” to kowtow to parents at the expense of their children. You don’t address the needs of the students with gender dysphoria, or how “sex-based sports participants are restricted according to biological sex” goes against Williams v. Kincaid. This is VA DOE mostly washing their hands of a complicated situation, claiming they can't interfere. It is stupid, cruel and short-sighted. But what else should I expect from a department that thinks “divisive issues” like slavery, negative history, gender issues, and sexual orientation should be banned from schools. When is science going to be considered “divisive?” Certain facts and theories certainly contradict religious doctrine. Will it fall to “religious freedom” too? If you can’t teach the facts, what’s the point of education? If you can’t support the mental health of students who should not be discriminated against according to the law, how can you claim to “care about all students”? How can you help a student thrive by insisting that he or she be called names and pronouns that give them dysphoria and make them suicidal? How can you claim to be non-discriminatory when your teachers, administrators, etc. model discriminatory, disrespectful, and bullying behavior in front of their students? What does that tell the other students about what is “acceptable behavior” to those with gender dysphoria? And why can’t people given the task of running a Department of Education not see the problem here? I know this is long, but you gave me a lot to work with. In brief, this policy stinks and does only half of what it claims to be written to do. And none of that helps the student, just the parents. And just remember, these students are going to be voters, some of them really soon. -- L. E. P.

"David Gorman, Professional School Counselor ",Strongly Oppose ,"56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality.

"Lorraine Dresch, Waynesboro Public Schools ",Strongly OPPOSE New Model Policies,"I am a representative of the Waynesboro High School Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, a group of educators dedicated to making the school a safe and welcoming environment for students of historically-marginalized backgrounds.   I would like to raise serious concerns regarding these model policies.  At WHS, there are approximately 90 transgender and gender-expansive students. These policies would directly negatively impact their daily lives by denying them the ability to safely express themselves and be affirmed for who they are. These students are deserving of protection and support. The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the new model policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a crucial form of suicide prevention.  Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: Transgender youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in part because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by caregivers due to their trans identity. The Trevor Project states that “38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth reported housing instability and homelessness.” By requiring educators such as teachers and guidance counselors to automatically inform parents of their child’s transgender identity if the student comes out at school, the state puts young people in a position where they must either suppress their identities entirely or risk the roof over their heads.  In summary, these new policies would in reality deny students the privacy, dignity, and respect they deserve. Schools have an important role in supporting the mental health and safety of their transgender and nonbinary students. As an educator dedicated to creating learning environments where everyone can thrive, I urge you to reject or at the very least substantially revise these model policies to protect trans youth.  Sincerely, Lorraine Dresch, Waynesboro High School Teacher https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2020/?section=Introduction  https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Trevor-Project-Homelessness-Report.pdf",,9/26/22  9:01am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129057

Mr. Youngkin: As Governor of an entire state, you have a responsibility to govern for ALL Virginians, whether they voted for you or not. This is not limited to only the people who share your personal views - or to benefit your long-term political goals.  Please consider that a year into your role as Governor, your aim should be to support Virginians, not to make vulnerable communities and young students feel more marginalized. These hurtful proposed policies could have serious negative impacts on young children for years to come. The long-term effects of not feeling accepted as who you are during a vulnerable time in your life will not go away in the short-term.",129074,9/26/22  9:08am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129074

But the Virginia Department of Education is rejecting those values and advancing a policy that would target trans and non-binary kids for bullying and mistreatment just because of who they are. The proposed policies seek to erase trans and non-binary youth from the classroom and create a hostile and even dangerous school environment. They restrict restroom access and sports participation for transgender and nonbinary students, require faculty and staff to “out” trans and nonbinary students to their parents, and prohibit teachers and staff from supporting trans students in a range of ways, including blocking them from using a student’s affirming name and pronouns. The effect can be devastating to these youth -- not only increasing the incidence of bullying, but increasing depressions and other mental health issues and possibly even suicide.

Krista Martin ,LGBT Mom of LGBT Children Supports This Measure ,"Let me begin by saying that I am an openly gay mother of several openly gay children that I would give my last breath for. I have been very active in their school life since 2009 when my oldest began kindergarten in Spotsylvania. I have not always agreed with things that have happened in their schools, eg; taking away Spanish as an elective, using the taking away of playground time as a form of punishment, to name a few, but I stand by the staff at my children’s schools because I come from a long line of teachers myself and I have seen first hand the love and dedication it takes to be an educator. That being said, those educators are not my children’s parents, I am.  Those teachers are not their healthcare providers, the medical teams I have carefully selected over 19 years and have been charged with giving the level of care my children need, are. They are also not the therapists or psychiatrists in charge of my children’s mental health, again, the team I selected and they agree to, are. If there is an issue I need to be made aware of, especially when the consequences of keeping it a secret could be life altering, it is my right as a parent to know so that I can go to the medical teams and address it with the appropriate authorities so my children can receive the care they need. While I understand not every parent is as understanding and loving as myself and my husband, I still believe it is the parents right and the schools obligation to inform parents  of concerns involving their children, from poor grades, bullying, to medical concerns. I also understand that there are concerns of potential abuse stemming from “outing” a child, I take them seriously as we all should, but school administrators, teachers, and guidance staff are all trained court mandated reporters. This means the door will open for getting children out of homes that are dangerous for them. As Virginians we should be concerned for a movement that seeks to keep parents for being involved in their children’s lives, especially considering how some counties have covered up sexual assaults or other issues like riots and large scale fights among other things. Where does it stop? When do parental rights end and those of the educational system begin?",129107,9/26/22  9:15am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129107
Annette Fritz ,This is an attempt to harm students and schools ,"Students are NOT solely the property of their parents and do have rights granted to them that Virginia is attempting to ignore. It is NOT the responsibility of schools to out queer students to parents; if parents have put any work into their relationship with their children, than they would know already if their child wants to use different names. The parents who applaud this expect the school to take over their parental responsibility to build a relationship with their kids. Furthermore, if most who want this policy actually spent time in school activities with their kids, they’d find out very quickly what their child is going by and their child’s thoughts. This is the government overreaching into schools for parents too lazy to actually parent their child and create a loving environment at home for their own children.  It will also place undue burden on teachers and open the schools for liability when a name is forgotten to be passed on or a parent accuses an unknowing teacher of hiding a name that the kid told their friends, but never explicitly told the teacher.  For the kids who will be outed to unsupportive or bigoted parents, the results can end in death, homelessness, and physical or emotional abuse. Studies show repeatedly that queer kids are not inherently more likely to be suicidal than their peers EXCEPT when faced with unsupportive family or school environments. Per the Trevor Project and the UCLA and Williamson Center, students in supportive environments fair significantly better than students who are forced into unsafe and unsupportive environments.  Stop using children and public education as pawns in your political games. Stop trying to damage public education. ",129109,9/26/22  9:15am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129109

Respecting every individual is not hard to do and can be accomplished with the original model policies that the General Assembly and the last administration put together.   The actual studies around transgender/non-binary school policies does not support the bathroom and sports policies that this administration is proposing.  These policies prohibit access and/or participation in activities consistent with their gender identity without real evidence that any other children are harmed by inclusion. Hiding transphobia and hatred of what is different from what you consider the norm behind some vague notion of parental choice is absurd.  These policies are an intrusion into families' choices, not a support for each parent making choices for how they raise their children.  It is laughable to call these supportive of parental choice.  I implore the Board of Education to reject these reject these policies as they are fueled by hatred and do the exact opposite of what they claim to do--they restrict parents choices on how to raise their children and make it harder for teachers and faculty to support parental choice for parents of transgender and non-binary children.",129117,9/26/22  9:18am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129117

Alex Weathersby ,No Rollback on Transgender Students Rights,"As a constituent of Charlottesville City, alum of Albemarle County Schools, sexual/domestic violence preventionist, and queer adult, I wholeheartedly disagree with the proposed changes to this policy. Transgender students deserve to be safe.   Having one’s name and pronouns accepted is a well-researched method of lowering suicide risk in transgender youth (Bailey et al., 2014; Bauer et al., 2015a; Haas et al., 2011; SPRC, 2008). Forcing staff to only use a students' legal name/deny them access to school bathrooms will negatively affect the mental health of both parties (the student, for being denied such a basic right as to be called what they want to be called, and the staff for being mandated to break trust with a student). The policy also creates pointless issues for non-transgender students - in my middle school class in Virginia, several students went by nicknames that had nothing to do with their legal names (""Carrie"" went by ""Morgan"", Xiang Zhi went by ""John""). This policy puts an undue burden of cost, time, and money on parents and youth to legally change the child's name in order for them to be identified appropriately on the day-to-day.   Single-stall bathrooms are few and far between, especially in rural counties where all students might attend a single middle or high school; facilities such as stadiums and locker rooms; or campuses that are spread across multiple buildings. Policies that state transgender and nonbinary youth can only access single-stall bathrooms or else be forced to use bathrooms aligned with assigned sex is therefore an access issue.  Mandating staff to out students to their parents puts youth at risk for abuse from unaffirming family members. The harm from this action can be anything from the guardians pulling the student from school counseling, to kicking them out of the home entirely, to physical abuse, suicide, or even murder of the child.  Children thrive when they feel safe in schools - all changes should be rejected. ",129120,9/26/22  9:18am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129120

"Kayla Chonoles, Waynesboro High School ","Re: 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in VA","To Whom It May Concern, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools. I am an English teacher at Waynesboro High School, and I participate in many school activities as a class co-sponsor and as a part of the theater department. I would like to raise serious concerns regarding these model policies.  At WHS, there are approximately 90 transgender and gender-expansive students. These policies would directly negatively impact their daily lives by denying them the ability to safely express themselves and be affirmed for who they are. These students are deserving of protection and support. The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the new model policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a crucial form of suicide prevention.  Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: Transgender youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in part because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by caregivers due to their trans identity. The Trevor Project states that “38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth reported housing instability and homelessness.” By requiring educators such as teachers and guidance counselors to automatically inform parents of their child’s transgender identity if the student comes out at school, the state puts young people in a position where they must either suppress their identities entirely or risk the roof over their heads.  In summary, these new policies would in reality deny students the privacy, dignity, and respect they deserve. Schools have an important role in supporting the mental health and safety of their transgender and nonbinary students. As an educator dedicated to creating learning environments where everyone can thrive, I urge you to substantially revise these model policies to protect trans youth.  Sincerely, Kayla Chonoles Masters of Arts in Teaching, 2019 https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2020/?section=Introduction  https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Trevor-Project-Homelessness-Report.pdf  ",,9/26/22  9:19am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129124
Anonymous ,Protect Trans Kids,"As an adult trans woman I oppose this rule. I spent my teenage years suffering in silence, thinking nobody else could possibly understand, or that there was no way I would ever be accepted at school—and that was before there even were rules about this at the state level. I was unspeakably depressed, and it really only got worse as time went on and I continued developing without any intervention. I grew to hate my body and hate myself, all because I knew I could never reach my ideal. And reaching my ideal was the only option—otherwise I knew I would be rejected and abused by society. The solution to this problem was not learning to accept this misery, learning to play this role I had been assigned without complaint. The solution was realizing that I had control over my own life, that I had a say in who I grew up to be. That is what trans kids need. They don’t need to be silenced and denied and shamed. They need to know that there is a chance for them to be who they want to be. Reject this new rule. The 2021 guidance was the correct policy and should not be negated.",129125,9/26/22  9:19am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129125

As a school professional who is connected with other school divisions around the state, I have heard of no true, verified problems created by this 2021 policy (only the solutions and protections it put in place.) To the degree that there are any real (not imagined or theoretical) issues raised by the 2021 model policy, then the next step would be to proposed very specific adjustments, not a wholesale roll-back. During the 2021 comment period, I reviewed the public comments. Among those who were afraid of supporting trans and non-binary students, all to many literally used phrases such as ""bring back bullying."" In proposing a reversal to the 2021 model policy, I am afraid that Virginia is listening to such fear-based, irrational, and hateful voices.",129126,9/26/22  9:19am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129126
Anonymous ,Strongly Support,"Both of my children at one point thought they might be trans. Their entire friend groups thought so too, and I noticed the contagion aspect of it all, so I just gave them the room to feel out the identity without any pressure to do something about it on my end. I approached it the same as I would have if they shared their interest in a new band or hobby. Low and behold, they both grew out of it. I'm lucky in regards to having close relationships with my children who feel comfortable enough to speak openly about things they are going through, but had they not had that, I can imagine them getting further caught up in going down a road that isn't actually who they are, because that's exactly what the schools are creating. They've both told me of the pressures of being anything other that ""cis"" and ""white."" How it's the worst of the worst and schools have made them feel unworthy of their humanity due to their innate sexual nature/preference and their skin color. So, it's no wonder when one in a friend group says they're trans and the schools are constantly pumping out trans/queer talking points, the whole group starts experimenting with the label, as it's an easy way to escape the stigma of being an ""oppressor."" That's absolutely the environment being created in schools currently.  For what it's worth, up until all of this trans ideology started getting pushed, I had been a staunchly democratic voter. I just can not anymore with where the left is going. Seeing what I've now seen, I know if I was a teen currently, I'd be caught up in it all too. I was a tomboy that grew into a confident woman because no one cared that I was gender non-conforming and preferred playing with the boys. Were I in schools now, I'd be pressured and fast tracked into a trans identity because I guess we're going back to sexist stereotypes.

"Henrico Parent, M.Ed ",Strongly Opposed ,"The policy released for transgender and non-binary students is extremely dangerous and cruel. Children know who they are, and as adults we should trust them to show their true selves. This policy absolutely does not protect children and parents’ rights. This protects bigots who are afraid of people different from them. When we don’t allow students to be their true selves, we risk their safety and mental health.  As a teacher, currently on child rearing leave, I can assure you that students can only learn and thrive in a place where they feel safe, loved, and valued. Teachers must first ensure that Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs are met so that children can learn. Part of this is ensuring a child’s safety.  By forcing families to provide permission and documents to support their children, and forcing children to out themselves in potentially unsafe situations, you are doing the exact opposite of these things. Follow the research, which these policies are wrong on a human and educational level, and state law. Trans and non-binary students are valued and deserving of a space to learn where they can truly be themselves, without interference and permission from an adult.  As a parent, if my children choose to use a different bathroom or pronouns they will be supported and loved. I expect the same from any classroom and school my child enters. This would not be the case, should these policies be in place. ",129129,9/26/22  9:21am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129129

"Albert Pollard, ",Reject or heavily amend the proposal. Respect trans kids.,"As the father of a transgender child and also a former legislator, I ask that you reject these changes. It is a matter of opinion and not of fact that ""The 2021 Model Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools.""  While respectful, I was pretty ignorant of trans issues before my son came out. To that end, I think the most helpful thing to realize when reviewing these new guidelines is that a young adult is not ""changing their gender"", rather those around them have a new realization of their gender.  That is, for a true trans child their gender has been the same all along, it is merely the adults perception that has changed.  I would also like to point out that this model policy doesn't separate schools and parents, it injects government into the life of parents and a child.  Asking teachers to police nicknames is just silly and waste of time... Christopher, a male, now goes by Chris and has long hair. Maybe the child is transitioning. Government to the rescue! Call the parents! Maybe next we should have teachers contact the parents if their kids are dating another child because it might be a violation of the parental rights that their child dates someone... In fact the proper teacher response to a gay or trans child is: Are, are they ""coming out""?!? Who cares! Do they have poor grades and seems depressed... that is when you care and reach out to a school counselor.  There are many tricky issues around this topic but they involve permanent life decisions such as surgery. The school system won't be involved in these in any regard and the parent should have every traditional right over an unemancipated minor in these cases. Everything else is - names, dress, etc is transitory and not the government's business.  Albert Pollard Irvington VA 22480  ",129131,9/26/22  9:21am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129131

It is incredibly harmful to not respect individuals enough to call them by their name and pronouns. Every death of a student if these policies go into place are because of Youngkin. If this was about respect of beliefs, then these policies would not exist.

Erica Sims ,Oppose this Guidance,"As a parent of a young child attending Virginia public schools, I oppose this guidance. It is clear in reading the comments in support of this guidance that this ""parents rights"" or ""parents choice"" language is a guise. The guidance seems to me to seek to shame and delegitimize transgender and other nonbinary identities. Commenters in support of this guidance make claims around the physical and sexual safety of children - saying that to keep children safe from predatory behavior, this guidance must be approved. Commenters state that transgender or nonbinary identities are not scientifically or emotionally valid, that they don't exist and should not be recognized by society. This is what is at the heart of this bill, not parent involvement. No one on either side of this debate wants parents to be eliminated from important decisions and discussions related to their children. To suggest otherwise is a perfect example of gaslighting. Our current school system and guidance allows me, as a parent, to be as fully involved as I need and want to be in important decisions concerning my child.

Anonymous ,"This is wrong, oppose.","There are several parts of this proposal that I'd like to go over. For one, forcefully outing kids to their parents is setting up some of them to be abused and murdered by relatives that don't understand or choose not to. Their suffering would be on you. Furthermore, not every kid who thinks they might be trans actually is, they could be just seeing how different styles or pronouns fit them in the safety of school. And by forcefully outing them, you might take away that experimentation, putting even cis kids in danger. Also, where is the line drawn? If a young cis girl isn't performing femininity to your standards, does she get ""outed"" as trans? Is she no longer allowed to use the bathroom that she feels most comfortable using? Is she kicked off of her sports teams? It doesn't make any sense, and is frankly just a disgusting way of controlling kids. As for the restriction of using a preferred name, that also makes absolutely no sense. I remember so many kids asking to be called nicknames or something other than their legal names, and more often than not that made it easier on the teachers. Many kids asked to be called something else if someone shared their first name in the class. This proposal would completely take that possibility from them, leading to more issues. Then there's the fact that some people never even really go by their legal names. I knew someone who, from being a small child, they had a nickname and pretty much everyone called them by it. And none of that is even taking into account the fact that being called your deadname on a daily basis, hurts. It frankly should be avoided at all cost, or the person will just come to associate that name with terrible things. That's what happened with my deadname. My mom refuses to use my name, and I feel genuine hate towards that name instead of just thinking that it wasn't for me, like I used to. Protect trans kids, protect cis kids, but those protections DO NOT have to come at the cost of the other.

"Katharine Smorodin, School Counselor ",Strongly Oppose,"56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020). Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for transgender males and 149% for transgender females (Murchison et al., 2019). 28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020).

Parent. Teacher. Coach. ,Support this revised policy ,"I fully support the proposed 2022 Guidelines.  The 2021 Guidance put schools in the position of severing the parent-child relationship, of deciding what is best for a child and of unduly influencing a minor child.  While supportive schools are essential, and the rights of every student are equally important, parents know, love and care for their children far more than schools, which are transient in a child's life.  The previous 2021 guidance went far beyond State and Federal Law in wresting decision-making and authority away from parents and handing it over to schools and non-guardians.   This new guidance appropriately revokes the deceit authorized by the 2021 guidance, which in practice directed schools to conceal its interactions with a minor child, whether over counseling or use of pronouns, facilities etc. This deceitful aspect of the 2021 guidance was one of its most problematic and dangerous features. The previous guidance put girls and women in harm's way by allowing males into all their safe spaces.  While the intent of the 2021 guidance is to allow transgender students to chose facilities, the practice in the way it is worded disallows questioning of any male entering a female space.  Further, the population of girls and women who have been victims of sexual assault is far greater than the population of transgender students, and it is wrong and dangerous for these women to have to fear males entering private spaces with them. There are reasonable and fair ways to protect transgender students without taking away the right to privacy and safety of every female in the system. Further, the former guidance unlawfully compelled speech as to pronoun usage, again going far beyond both State and federal law.  Every child deserves equal respect, but the law does not grant them the right to compel the speech of others. Every school will have to work out ways to respect and support transgender children, including for children who may face danger at home. It goes without question that support, compassion and respect are essential to caring for transgender children in schools. The answer, however, is not a blanket order affecting all families by unlawfully removing parental authority and involvement from a child's life, as was the effect of the previous guidance.  Schools and counselors should be partners with children and parents, not usurpers of parental roles. This policy is a great step forward in removing the excesses of the 2021 Guidance. I borrowed these words from another supporter because they said so eloquently what I too wish to say and why I support these revisions. Please support parental rights and what’s good and just for kids. ",129182,9/26/22  9:34am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129182
Anonymous ,I OPPOSE THE PROPOSED 2022 MODEL,"I OPPOSE the proposed 2022 Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools. This document will only hurt transgender students and will undo all the progress we have made to protect them from bullying and harrassment. 1. This proposal requires teachers and staff to forcibly “out” students to their parents. This is extremely dangerous, as many parents are not accepting, thus creating a hostile home environment. This will also prevent transgender students from speaking to an adult whom they trust at school. Teachers are not only there to teach; they are there to provide support and guidance when a student needs it the most.2. Teachers and staff are prohibited from using a trans student’s name and pronouns unless given permission from their parents. Studies have proven time and time again that using a trans person’s correct name and pronouns significantly improves their mental health and can help prevent suicide. By forcing staff to use a student’s deadname and incorrect pronouns, you are creating an extremely stressful environment for them. In addition, cis children have been allowed to use nicknames that are different from their legal names forever; how is a trans child with a different name from their records any different? 3. This model requires transgender students to play on sport’s teams that align with their assigned sex at birth. This is also dangerous for not only transgender students but every student. How is this going to be enforced? I fear that genital inspections will become the norm. There has also been a news story where a parent wanted to check if a girl who beat their child in a sport’s competition was transgender. This is a complete invasion of privacy. Sports in schools are also about fostering a sense of teamwork and community. You are taking this away from transgender children.Overall, this model will only HARM transgender and non-binary students. It does absolutely nothing to protect them in a place they are required to attend every day. It also goes completely against all the guidance from medical professionals and statistics that show how trans children’s mental health significantly improves when we respect them.

John ,Oppose changes due to certainty of student harm,"I am a lifelong resident of Virginia, and I oppose the proposed changes to this guidance document. Transgender children are at a great risk. The life they must lead is inherently difficult, and can be made much worse by humiliations and hostility from their community and the adults responsible for their care and education. This can unfortunately lead to severe mental health struggles and even suicide. It is very important here to take the position supported overwhelmingly by science: affirming the gender identity of trans people dramatically reduces their suffering, and their risk of suicide. Respectfully, giving transgender people this basic degree of dignity is far more important than the ""rights of parents"" to be bigoted and reject someone's very self, religiously motivated or otherwise. The former is life-saving. Respecting a transgender person's identity is not an ideological position or an opinion; it's a matter of fundamental humanity and respect, if you care at all about the well-being of that person (as demonstrated by scientific consensus). Therefore, to systematically insist that a transgender person is not who they are (as these proposed guidelines would allow school staff and students to do uninhibited, through condoning the use of incorrect pronouns and names, or by requiring trans students to share intimate spaces with members of the wrong gender), in complete disregard for the negative consequences this will have on that person, is an act of inhuman malice.

Kirby M ,Do not support this cruel measure,"Being trans is not a fad. People who experience difficulty with their assigned gender at birth face a challenging road of self-discovery even when they do not have to contend with an entire political party doing everything in its power to vilify their support network and their choices. Carrying out this policy is a blatant political ploy that will result in harm to children, and those who support this policy have received ample warning about what it will do. To be clear, Republicans did not suddenly become concerned about trans children overnight. They already hated trans people and they found a way to legitimize and disguise their straightforward bigotry. If you implement this policy, any harm that comes to trans children is blood on your hands. If you really care about helping children, you should think long and hard about why you think it's OK to side with the group that are perfectly fine seeing trans children suffer and won't even concede that whatever their concerns about cis children, some kids really are trans and need our help.

Wren ,Gov. Younkin is putting youth in danger,"As a queer, nonbinary person myself, gov. younkin's actions are putting our community in danger. Apart from the harmful rhetoric about trans people in general (who are overwhelmingly more likely to be the victim of a crime than the perpetrator of it) both forcing people in or out of the closet is going to have costs. Being forced in the closet can feel oppressive, as you are forced to act a part for everyone with no reprieve to live authentically (an experience glenn will never have to understand) on the other hand, being outed before you are ready can set people (youth especially) up to face physical and emotional violence at the hands of family and peers. LGBT people, especially trans people, already have much higher rates of eating disorders, mental illness, self harm, and suicide then the general public. More so in communities that make it clear that they are not safe and welcome. youngkin is fine letting youth suffer to feed a lie passed on by people with power and prejudice.  Someone's personal gender or queer identity is no business of the state, apart from changing one's name on official documents. This should go doubly for youth, who's gender transition consists of nothing more than a new name and wardrobe - something many youth queer or otherwise will experience. If Abigail wants to go by Abby and dress goth that is seen as youthful exploration of identity, however if Abigail wants to go by Elliott and dress more masculine they are ""indoctrinated"" or are somehow in danger or putting their community in danger. Exploring your identity is essential to growing up, and queer youth deserve to do so safely without fearing that adults who are supposed to protect them will put them further in danger.  The choice to not capitalize gov. youngkin's name is purposeful - bigotry does not earn the respect of capitalization.  To any queer youth (or young at heart) that may be reading this looking for any kind of support - it does get better. Our community will welcome you with open arms by any name or label that you choose. Seek community, pass on as much love as possible, and build other's up in a world that constantly wants to tear us down. Queer existence is radical, and no person should have to align their identity to fit within the confines of the wishes of the state. There is no one mold for being human, there are centuries of queer people standing with you, and millions waiting to welcome you into our community today.  ",129220,9/26/22  9:47am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129220

Anonymous ,Support ,"It is unfortunate that public schools have been at the forefront of the identity politics game, and it is way past time to protect the children from this tug 'o war. There is a pandemic of gender dysphoria and our most vulnerable population has borne the brunt. Celebration and affirmation of such a disorder may not be the best course of action, but even if it were, the schools are not in place to decide or pass judgement in either direction. If I remember correctly, schools are a place of learning. While some bias is unavoidable because teachers and children are human beings, the focus of school should be fundamentally education, not social engineering. Teachers and counselors are not co-parenting, nor do they have the right to attempt to do so. On the other hand, for teachers and counselors who do not fall in line with the current progressive march, compelled speech like self-generated pronouns is inappropriate and violates the 1st Amendment.  Personally, I would like to see the government step out of education entirely, but if it needs to be a necessary evil (which I doubt), then its role should be narrowly defined to teach the fundamentals, such as reading and arithmetic, writing and history, science and trades, music and life skills (such as gardening, cooking, and budgeting).  I fully support this attempt to limit the role of our schools in the battle of gender politics.   ",129234,9/26/22  9:51am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129234

counselor ,strongly oppose,"The Virginia School Counselor Association (VSCA) opposes the Virginia Department of Education’s 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools as they are currently proposed. The 2022 model policies create barriers to privacy, dignity, and respect for Virginia’s students and seek to undermine previous legislation (i.e., § 22.1-23.3. Treatment of transgender students; policies) that works to create safe and supportive environments for our most vulnerable youth.  VSCA recognizes that: 56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020). Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for transgender males and 149% for transgender females (Murchison et al., 2019). 28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020). Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked out or abused (Thoma, 2021). Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022). Virginia school counselors work to remove barriers and support the social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. VSCA Ends Policies state that “Virginia School Counselors are committed to working with and advocating for marginalized groups, promote the mental health and wellness of all students, adhere to the ASCA Ethical Standards for School Counselors, and actively work to dismantle destructive systemic inequities.” Additionally, Virginia school counselors follow the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Position Statement on The School Counselor and Transgender and Nonbinary Youth (Adopted 2016, revised 2022) that states:  School counselors work to safeguard the well-being of transgender and nonbinary youth. School counselors recognize all students have the right to be treated equally and fairly, with dignity and respect as unique individuals, free from discrimination, harassment and bullying based on their gender identity and gender expression. Finally, Virginia school counselors seek to create environments that are not only inclusive and equitable for all students, including our transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students, but that celebrate the full scope of their identities, allowing them to thrive and reach their fullest potential. Furthermore, Virginia school counselors commit to dismantling any and all forms of inequity in Virginia’s public education system and fully support LGBTQ+ students. Every Virginia student, regardless of their gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation, has a right to learn free from discrimination and harassment. Against this background, it is VSCA’s stance that the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools are empirically unfounded and are not in accordance with evidence-based best practices concerning the treatment of transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students.",,9/26/22  9:57am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129257
Donivan  Potter ,I Opposed this harmful new policy ,"I'm a little bit different than the average transgender person. I happen to have an unknown muscle condition. The muscle condition gets worse with stress and other factors. treating my gender dysphoria medically with hormones has been the only thing to help lower my cpks, that's the muscle tissue enzymes breaking down. nothing else ever worked to lower my cpks to normal. When you refer to somebody that is transgender and suffering gender dysphoria like myself a pronoun that's not appropriate, one that goes against my identity.  it adds stress which causes my muscles to tense and that causes my muscle tissue to break down more.  that causes toxins to build up into me it's where my organs can fail. It's a shame that you think your beliefs are more important than my life and health.  I transitioned to save my life, Republicans with your hate and your ignorance you're negating all my efforts to save my life. All I know is ignorance and hate does not belong in schools. and that's what this new policy is it's nothing but ignorance and hate. I have a neighbor that listens to Youngkin and other people that spread rhetoric and lies about transgender people. My neighbor, he says that people like LGBT need to be took out and murdered. The fact this policy wants teachers to out LGBTQ students to people like my neighbor is wrong and dangerous. Not all parents are supportive and some are just like my neighbor. I didn't come out to my own parents my mom never knew. my dad finally knew late in life. I was scared about losing them, I can't imagine the stress that students will feel knowing that you're going to try to out them.  that stress would have prevented me from having a good education at all. the fact that I had to hide my identity prevented me from having a good education. I never learned nothing about myself in school, not in health class or any other class for that matter. I felt alone isolated and scared the whole time. That's what you're doing again, repeating history and you're doing wrong by people you're causing more harm than any good with this rotten policy.",129258,9/26/22  9:57am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129258

Caitlyn White ,Strongly oppose,"These proposed policies are discriminatory and cruel and will be the cause of so much harm if passed. Kids go to school to learn, not to be disrespected and told who they are is wrong and shameful. What pronouns or names kids use has nothing to with learning and education and is absolutely not your place to regulate. Banning children from sports  and telling them what bathrooms they are allowed to use is ridiculous. Is banning children from school activities and telling them they can’t participate because of who they are, is that what you want your legacy to be?? And anyones bathroom use is absolutely none of your business. As for forcing schools and teachers to out Lgbtq students and tell their parents- absolutely ignorant and an act of violence. You will be putting so many children in danger and their blood will be on your hands. There are countless parents and family that are unsafe and unsupportive and you are putting children at the risk of homelessness, abuse, conversion therapy, and death. 50% of all teens get a negative reaction when coming out to their parents and 1 in 4 teens are forced to leave their homes after coming out. And Roughly 34% of LGBT youth report suffering physical violence from their parents as a result of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. You will be actively putting kids in harms way. And that’s not even taking into account the effects on their mental health. Being told they can’t do this or that and their identity is shameful and has to be reported to possible unsupportive parents- this will add even more to the mental health crisis in lgbtq youths. More than half of transgender and nonbinary youth have seriously considered suicide and Lgbtq youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide than their peers. Discriminating against them and regulating every part of them and putting them In harms way will only make it worse. Is that the legacy you want? To be the ones who increased youths suicide rates and homelessness?? We should be encouraging children and helping their lights to grow and be confident in themselves, not completely stifling that light. Maybe worry more about school shootings and bullying and the youth in poverty that can’t afford food or school supplies, instead of what’s in their pants and what name they prefer. Do something to make things better for kids, not worse. ",129264,9/26/22  9:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129264

It would be irresponsible and put the lives of children at risk should this policy be implemented.   As an aside, this policy also affects cis children as well as trans children. As the policy reads, any child with a nickname ""that is not commonly associated with their name"" (which leaves a lot of wiggle room with interpretation. How can I know what is and isn't an associated nickname?) who wants to use said nickname in the class, I would be required to call their parents and ask if that is okay.

Melissa ,PROTECT TRANS & NON-BINARY YOUTH!!!,"I implore the Board of Education to reject these policies as they are fueled by hatred and transphobia, and are both disgusting and disgraceful.! We must protect transgender and non-binary youth! Trans and non-binary children deserve the same safety and autonomy afforded to their cis peers. Trans youth face extremely high rates of suicide attempts because they already feel excluded, different, and unsafe in their own bodies, in their own homes. This policy will have a direct effect to make that WORSE for trans children in Virginia schools, make no doubt that if enacted this will be responsible for a higher rate of suicide among queer kids. The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the new model policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a crucial form of suicide prevention. Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: Transgender youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in part because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by caregivers due to their trans identity. The Trevor Project states that “38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth reported housing instability and homelessness.” By requiring educators such as teachers and guidance counselors to automatically inform parents of their child’s transgender identity if the student comes out at school, the state puts young people in a position where they must either suppress their identities entirely or risk the roof over their heads. Mandating staff to out students to their parents puts youth at risk for abuse from unaffirming family members. The harm from this action can be anything from the guardians pulling the student from school counseling, to kicking them out of the home entirely, to physical abuse, suicide, or even murder of the child.",129285,9/26/22  10:01am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129285

Parent of two high schoolers ,"New policy is cruel, unsupportive, and WRONG","According to Pew research, 5% of young adults in the US identify as trans or non-binary. Studies show that 40% of trans youth have attempted suicide, and 82% have contemplated it. Trans and non-binary kids need all the support they can get, both at home and at school.  If they are not getting support at home, the LEAST they should have is support at school.  An environment where kids are rejected for who they are at home AND at school is where you get 40% suicide rates.  Is that really what we want for 5% of our youth?? For those who wouldn't support their child who came out as trans, consider that situation carefully.  It can be a life or death decision.  But I digress... For those who don't have a trans kid, or don't know a trans kid, or don't know anyone who has a trans kid, you probably do.  You just don't know it yet.  Remember, 5%.  5%.  This 5% of our youth need ALL the love and support the community can give them, and this new Younkin policy rips that support away in the guise of ""parent's rights"" and ""free speech for teachers"".  That's laughable.  This is an anti-trans policy that is cruel, unsupportive, and just plain WRONG.

I am writing today to express my strong opposition to the Governors proposed changes that would directly impact the lives of trans students in the Commonwealth of Virginia.Transgender students deserve to feel safe and accepted just like every other person. and trans youth are already at a higher risk of depression, suicide, and violence. This decision is leading to make the lives harder of kids and teens already struggling with their gender identity and sexual orientation. Some statistics for you to consider - 40% of all homeless youth in the United States identify as LGBTQ+ (Morton, M.H., Dworsky, A., Matjasko, J.L., Curry, S.R., Schlueter, D., Chávez, R. & Farrell, A.F. (in press). Prevalence and correlates of youth homelessness in the United States. Journal of Adolescent Health.), three-quarters of students who identify as transgender or non-binary have felt unsafe at school because of the way they expressed their gender (75.1%), and of those students who identified as “another gender” or “genderqueer,” two-thirds felt unsafe at school (‘another gender” 61.2% and “genderqueer” 61.6% ). Finally, trans people are over 4 times more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime. This guidance also runs the very real risk of forcing teachers to out students against their will, which could lead to the potential of violence and abuse against the child. I want to make this very clear, just because it is 2022 and the LGBTQ+ rights movement has made strides over the last decade or so does not mean we are completely safe. Even now kids are thrown out of their homes, beaten and abused just for being who they truly are. People who are LGBTQ+ deserve the right to come out to people when they are ready and only when they are ready, as I did at the age of 21.  Children deserve to feel safe at school and at home, and I hope the administration will change its stance and stop this dangerous guidance from going into effect.",,9/26/22  10:02am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129301
Christopher J. Campa ,"Being Transgender is real, not an illness. Oppose!","I oppose these changes to school policies that prevent Transgender students from using facilities that correspond with their gender identity.  Being Transgender is real, not an illness.  I know many transgender people and they are exactly like every cisgender person I’ve known.  Like Dwyane Wade said, it’s not the transgender kids that have a problem.  It’s the adults mentality that’s the problem. These Transgender students know who they are better than most.  Preventing them from using the bathroom and locker rooms at school will not erase them.

Kelsey Wright ,Strongly Oppose,"I strongly oppose the guidelines proposed by the Board of Education. I believe they are dangerous, harmful and discriminatory. School should be a safe, accepting and supportive environment for all students, especially LGBTQ+ students. Students should not be deadnamed or forced into the wrong bathrooms. Many students are not able to safely come out to their families, let alone be accepted. They should be able to be out at school and live their truth without fear that they will be outed to their families. Outing students will inevitably lead to some students being abused at home, and some harming themselves. This harm is preventable and the blood will be on the hands of Governor Youngkin's Board of Education. These guidelines will worsen bullying and harassment of transgender and other LGBTQ+ students.  As stated by Dr. Moira Szilagyi, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, ""The emotional and psychological trauma of rejection, whether by family, friends, society, or lawmakers, can leave scars that never heal.?When we fail to accept people for who they are, we pass painful judgements on them and create so much unnecessary emotional and psychological pain.""

I cannot imagine a world in which any person, child or adult, telling me they identify as LGBTQ+ would cause me to then treat them as LESS of a human. Our schools should be the safest place for our students. No teacher or staff member should be forced by bigoted political legislation to put these children in danger either by “outing” them to someone who does not support who they are or by making them feel they must hide who they truly are in order to not be “outed”.  I cannot believe that we have come so far as a society, only to be actually discussing taking such a major step back.We have to do better.  We have to provide these students with safe placed to learn.  We have to provide them support and encouragement to be who they are.  And above all, we MUST treat them with respect and dignity.  ",129324,9/26/22  10:07am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129324

H Alston ,Strongly oppose this.,"It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth that ALL students have the opportunity to receive a high-quality education in Virginia (see: Code of Virginia, § 22.1-23.3). To quote, ""The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students. The Department also fully acknowledges the rights of parents to exercise their fundamental rights granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children. The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents to determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is essential to improving outcomes for all children in Virginia. The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological belief. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or religious beliefs."" This guidance document completely contravenes the current legal protection offered to all children by the Virginia Department of Education.

Those who seek to operate in secrecy do so to enable evil and lack the moral compass to be around children.

Chris Catanzaro ,Bring Back 2021 Model Policies,"The 2021 model policies for transgenered students were carefully crafted with a lot of input and collaboration from every type of stakeholder. The categories of stakeholders involved is clearly stated in the document, and it includes parents. However, the 2022 model clearly states that it includes the VALUES of parents. This is disturbing as a ""wolf disguised in sheeps clothing"". The basic issue here is NOT about empowering parents. People who are uninformed about transgenedered individuals are fearful and naturally want to protect their own children. And we all know that many children do not value peers who are different. This issue in the 2022 model policies was clearly written with a reactionary lens. It's not ok to discriminate against trans kids due to our personal values. This issue is about protections sadly necessary for transgenedered students. ""The Virginia Department of Education continuse to be ommitted to working with school divisions to ensure a positive, safe, and nurturing learning environment for all students.""

Repealing previous protections because parents have complained about their right to control their child's education and environment is not only an absurd overreaction to the concerns of a minority on an issue that does not affect their child's safety, it is an overreach of the BoE in that it is listening only to a privileged few who dedicate their lives to hurting others and allowing transphobes to control the school system. No other group this small has ever been granted this much power to control the policies that affect every student in Virginia. If parental rights are so important, what about the right of trans children's parents to not have to treat their children's depression and inability to be themselves?

Furthermore, LGBTQ plus children are subject to abuse and familial rejection if their parents refuse to acknowledge their gender identity, which is traumatizing. Governor Youngkin is exploiting children to further his political goals, as children as young as three experience gender dysphoria.

If you try to ""persuade"" your trans kids into being cis, you end up with a dead kid.What a child watches or knows about, doesn't suddenly change turn them into that thing, but hiding information from them is a sure sign you are at the very least manipulating your child and what they are allowed to think is ""okay"". If your child is begging teachers not to tell you that they're trans, maybe you should reflect on why your child is so scared of you. Children should be able to trust that their parents will help them, and be there for them, not actively abuse them every time them intentionally use the wrong name or tell them they don't know anything.Does no one remember what it was like being a child? Didn't you wish you could just cuddle with your momma and not worry about anything? Why are you so afraid of letting children feel safe within themselves?",129424,9/26/22  10:20am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129424
Anonymous ,Children have rights too. Opposed!!!,"Under the bill of rights, every citizen has the right to free speech under the first amendment. Children are people and citizens, they have the right to express themselves how they feel and the law should not impede on that. If a child identifies themselves a different way than their birth sex, it is their right. The law should not be involved unless it is to protect that right, otherwise it is infringing upon said rights. The US is a beautiful country for how we have laws to protect self expression, let's not force children into a world where they cannot be themselves nor be forced to bow to a temporary state of the ever shifting societal norm.   Children have the right to free speech too.

"Liz Todd, Virginia Educator ",Teacher Strongly Opposes Policy,"My concerns as an educator starts with my students. I am not a teacher for parents, I am a teacher for students. I want my students to be comfortable and feel safe in the classroom. I have already established trust with my trans students, and they know that their information is safe with me. If required to ask parents prior to using a name or set of pronouns, my students would not be able to be themselves in the class, and many would be afraid of repercussions should their parents find out. It would be irresponsible and put the lives of children at risk should this policy be implemented.   As an aside, this policy also affects cis children as well as trans children. As the policy reads, any child with a nickname ""that is not commonly associated with their name"" (which leaves a lot of wiggle room with interpretation. How can I know what is and isn't an associated nickname?) who wants to use said nickname in the class, I would be required to call their parents and ask if that is okay.

Anonymous ,Parent Strongly Opposes,"As a gay person who grew up long ago in Virginia public schools, supporting ALL students is imperative. If a child is made to feel inferior to their peers, especially by the adults tasked with teaching and caring for them, that child will most likely develop a host of mental and emotional problems. Being transgender is well established science, despite what some news organizations might say. It is also well established and documented that allowing free expression of however a child might be wishing to present themselves is healthy and does no harm to their development. Even the medical community agrees that even minimum support during puberty for a transgender child is completely reversible and does no harm to the child, and in fact helps them grow in a more positive way.  As a parent, I am appalled that school boards and local governments around the country are trying to pass rules and laws that directly harm children. The parents that are behind these actions are not doing so out of any factual issues, but out of fear mongering and bigotry. That has absolutely no place in our education system. This is no different than the uproar about segregation back in the 1960s, and the white people you see in the photos from that time screaming and throwing hatred at the black children just trying to attend schools could very well have been taken today with transgender children.  They are just as ugly now as they were then.",129442,9/26/22  10:22am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129442

Survivor of transphobia ,"Transphobia kills, transphobia maims","Less than a decade ago, I was a teenager living in rural northern Virginia. I knew fellow children who were regularly beaten for being LGBT+ while school staff looked the other way. I watched as many LGBT+ teens who didn't have the shield of being popular prior to coming out were discussed casually with slurs around lunch tables in hallways. I had to sit through a conversation with a well respected teacher and writer for the local paper as he described his disgust towards LGBT+ people and how they shouldn't be allowed in the military and don't ask don't tell shouldn't have ended.    I know children who didn't survive. I know people still in the area who cannot safely come out as transgender, and are planning on dying without telling anyone still in my hometown, because they fear severe violence. I myself, left my hometown as soon as I was physically able to, and promptly socially transitioned (with medical transition following shortly afterwards once I could afford it). I do not plan on returning to live there, because I fear severe violence from the community.    This policy encourages for a culture of violent anti-LGBT+ rhetoric to thrive within schools, and by extension the counties and towns these schools serve. It is a joke that it was ever considered as a state policy. Those who back it are fully knowledgeable that this policy is dangerous for students, but will appease the Christo-fascist voters who they want to gain support from.    Children who wish to by a different name, use different pronouns, dress differently, and use restrooms pose no threat to other students. Affirming them does them no harm. Affirming students does not harm the quality of education being received by their peers.  Children deserve to be safe at school, many do not have safe homes to return to at night.

Our kids don't want it and the overwhelming majority of parents don't want it. The small minority of cowardly and fearful parents pushing for policies like this don't get to make the rules for everyone else.  Hatred and discrimination are manifestations of fear. What are you afraid of governor? Are you afraid students will learn to be respectful of people that don't look like them, don't pray like them, and don't fit YOUR preconceived notions? Is respect, and tolerance, and inclusivity a threat to you and your supporters? Are you intent on churning out generations of bigots that enter the real world and find that they have been gaslighted by the adults making the rules? It does not hurt grown ups one damn bit to call a student by a preferred name. In fact, hundred of thousands of kids in Virginia schools go by a nickname different than their full legal name. No one asks parents for permission to call a kid Cathy instead of Catherine. And no grown up is ""harmed"" for not being a jerk.  Your rules are juvenile, harmful, and probably illegal.

Vic N ,Law and balancing all rights and sides,"Reading over the whole proposal: it puts an end to discrimination/harassment of any/all students. That means trans or not. Contrary to what is purveyed out in the media, teens who have detransitioned indicated they got a lot of support being trans.  it requires parents, who are constitutionally responsible for their offspring in every way, to consent to counseling services. Considering schools are not able to dispense medications without parental consent, this is consistent. It also requires them to consent to name/pronoun changes so they are again in charge of their offspring, having the right to raise them with the values they see fit, and not some agenda pushing public employee. This allows for freedom of speech for teachers to not agree - and something that any human has to get used to as not everyone is going to agree with your choices.  mandating safe spaces for each sex is provided for, thereby eliminating half of the student population that is upset enough to not go to the bathroom during school due to fear of the opposite sex coming in, also due to the rapes/sodomies that occurred, whereby school officials covered up the violence and allowed it to happen again.

"Laura O'Reilly, Parent and Voter ","Strongly oppose this harmful, unnecessary, unlawful proposed policy","I strongly oppose the Youngkin administration's proposed changes to the Model Policy. The proposed policies are hateful and harmful to LGBTQIA+ students, and all community members. There is no reason why queer students should not be able to live openly in their school community if they choose to do so. Mental health and medical providers, as well as educators, already know that anti-trans and homophobic policies and laws directly cause harm to these children. It is outrageous that this administration would target a vulnerable population for political gains. The policy is unnecessary to protect parents' rights because parents already have rights in their children's educations. It is a lie when they say that parents are cut out of the public school system. If parents want to be involved they can start by talking to their own kids and their kids' teachers. They can view all educational materials on line or in person at schools. They can review policies on line. They can attend PTA meetings, parent teacher conferences, and school board meetings. In the many years my children have attended public schools, when I have reached out to teachers or administrators, the responses have been open and transparent (even if I did not necessarily like the outcome). The policy literally asks school boards to violate the law by enforcing unconstitutional discrimination against transgender students. For example, the 4th Circuit's decision in the Grimm case explicitly held that schools must allow students to use the restroom of their identified gender, and yet this policy states the opposite. Conservatives claim to be for law and order, but this policy explicitly violates the law. This policy is using vulnerable students as political pawns before an extremely important election. Youngkin's attempt during the 2021 election to paint himself as the nice guy Republican has been completed debunked by his recent actions. This policy is not for the betterment of Virginia's schools or to support Virginia's students or parents. It is political pandering. The Model Policies should be rejected.",129496,9/26/22  10:31am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129496
Caroline Steinberg ,Opposition to Department of Education Guidance on Treatment of Transgender Children,"I strongly oppose the VA Department of Education's Guidance on the treatment of transgender youth. In defiance of state law, this policy does not follow evidence-based practices and puts our children at risk. Trans youth are nearly four times as likely to have attempted suicide as the population of secondary school students as a whole (see chart below with recent data for Fairfax County). It is only a wanton disregard for the lives of these children that policies can be promulgated that isolate these children even more than they already are.  It has been shown that even one supportive teacher or adult can make a difference in the life of a child. The teacher has a duty to the child not the parent. A sane bathroom policy would be to allow children to use the bathroom that conforms to their gender identity and then have a separate bathroom for anyone who is uncomfortable with that. Sports should be left to sports organizations. Certainly nothing below the high school level should even be an issue. It simply is not that important when weighed against the welfare of a VERY small group of children. Schools are government institutions, and school employees should not be able to impose their religious beliefs on their students or even articulate them as part of their role as a government employee. Separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our republic. If a teacher finds a particular student's identify offends their religion, then accommodations for that teacher should be made by transferring the teacher to another school or otherwise limiting their interaction with these children. The child should not be exposed to any harmful or disrespectful interactions. Name calling is bullying. Using a ""dead' name is name-calling. You may score political points for these heartless policies, but the blood of these children will be on your hands.              CommentID: 129497",129497,9/26/22  10:31am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129497

Meanwhile, the tiny percentage of MAGA Republican parents who enthusiastically support this cruelty are literally burning books and complaining about CRT--a racist dog whistle, if there ever was one. What a bloody waste of our time. This is an attempt to force our Public Schools into serving a tiny minority's narrow view of the world, a view formed by a single religion, which our Constitution clearly states has no place in government--and by extension our public schools. All religions are welcome in our country because our founders saw the consequences of forcing one religion on others.

Diane Deffenbaugh ,Strongly oppose,"First of all, discrimination against transgender individuals is illegal discrimination on the basis of sex. Secondly, restricting the rights of transgender students is morally repugnant. It will do harm to these students who the schools should be helping protect and nurture so that they may grow into their best selves. Their gender/name/pronoun choices are not hurting anyone else. They should be supported and loved. Not all parents support their children's choices, and the consequences can be catastrophic. Why would we want to create a policy that may cause children to be kicked out of their homes or even worse? This Pollyanna idea that everyone has perfect parents who will love them no matter what is ridiculous and unrealistic. If children are not out to their parents, it just may be for a very good reason. Not all homes are safe havens. But our schools should be for ALL students. The idea that teachers can ignore pronoun preferences etc based on their own beliefs is unbelievable and certainly sides with right-wing religious extremists. If a teacher doesn't believe a woman should have a career, can they then choose to not respect the girls in their class and only teach them cooking and cleaning? Should the biology teacher get to choose to teach creationism because that's what their church tells them? I don't care what a teacher's ""beliefs"" are. Respect every child in the class. Period. Protect every child in the class. Period. I believe this policy singles out one small segment of the population and makes it OK to discriminate against them based on a phony problem. There is no evidence that trans students are causing any kinds of problems in schools. And hiding our students from real world complexities, which include gender, is not educating them. It's indoctrinating them to one ideology. I keep hearing about ""parents rights."" Children should have rights, too.

The schools must protect children by respecting the wishes of students in respect to who they don’t feel are the safe adults in their lives.

I often hear that God doesn’t make mistakes. He didn’t make a mistake with me. He made my insides not quite match my outside. To interfere with that is to go against God.  But it necessary for schools and the government to protect children who are like me. We need to be protected from family and friends who would injure us for God’s choice to make us non-binary or transgender. We are very capable of understanding who is a danger to us for being non-binary or transgender. Schools most trust our instincts about the evil people around us. We don’t all have loving and supportive parents. Some of us have parents to squash our spirits and steal our childhoods.  Call kids what they want to be called.

Anonymous ,Strongly OPPOSE ,"OPPOSE- THROW IT OUT. This is literally laughable- this policy actively works against every current mental health and medical guideline (supported by actual research) about how to build policy related to trans kids/the treatment of trans kids. Though I guess that's apparent when the policy defines sex and not gender or even transgender, just ""a transgender student,"" and actively misgenders a transgender person in the additional laws section- making the bias of the policy writer pretty clear. It's interesting how much this policy talks about protecting ""parent's rights,"" as if they would somehow be undermined by a more reasonable policy that would actually protect transgender children- I cannot fathom how a basic acknowledgment that transgender people exist at all and can be treated with the absolute most basic, ground floor level of human decency and passing respect- even if you don't like them- would somehow take away parents role as the primary people raising their child. Should we also stop teaching kids to ask before trying to grab something out of another person's hand, to not hit each other, or other basic social skills?? After all- that might not be how it's done in their house!  Under the ""Maintenance of a safe and supportive learning environment free from discrimination and harassment for all students"" section, this policy seeks to state: The [School Division] prohibits all discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on actual national origin, race, religion, sex, disability, political beliefs, or any other characteristic protected by law. Honestly incredible, to specifically include political beliefs (not protected by law!) and NOT expand that sex also includes gender identity and sexuality (protected by law!) Also, for a policy that mentions bullying so many times, the plan to prevent harassment and bullying could not be more vague Overall- this is possibly the worst policy I have seen, and I would never allow any child of mine to be in any school that applied it, and if it is not scrapped or completely redone, I feel honestly heartbroken for any kids in a school that does apply it. ",129527,9/26/22  10:36am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129527

Anonymous ,Oppose: this is hateful discrimination against basic human expression ,"Despite any concern for children on may bring up in support of this policy, it’s been clear for years that this opens up hatred, bullying, and discrimination against any child who may not fit with what society says is Heterosexual at the time. We have proven that these practices only cause HARM and any potential benefit it has is overshadowed by immediate damage caused by isolation and discrimination. Trans kids need more aid not punishment out of paranoid unfounded fears. This witch hunt against trans people is an assault on US citizens. “A lack of policies and practices that affirm and support LGBT youth—and a failure to implement protections that do exist—means that LGBT students nationwide continue to face bullying, exclusion, and discrimination in school, putting them at physical and psychological risk and limiting their education. In 2001, Human Rights Watch published Hatred in the Hallways: Violence and Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Students in US Schools. The report documented rampant bullying and discrimination against LGBT students in schools across the country, and urged policymakers and school officials to take concrete steps to respect and protect the rights of LGBT youth.” © 2016 Mariam Dwedar for Human Rights Watch",129530,9/26/22  10:37am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129530

"Vanessa Dominguez, PhD, LPC, LMFT ",I STRONGLY OPPOSE THE GUIDANCE,"As a licensed professional counselor and counselor educator with a large public institution in the state, I STRONGLY OPPOSE the guidance being suggested by Gov. Youngkin. A recent study by the Trevor Project found that 45% of LGBTQIA+ youth have strongly considered attempting suicide in the past year, with BIPOC youth reporting even higher numbers. Students who report having a safe and affirming school environment report lower rates of suicide than their peers who report having hostile ones. Furthermore, less than 1 out of 3 transgender and non-binary students report having a safe and affirming home environment - which makes having a safe school environment imperative to their wellbeing. The policies suggested by Gov. Youngkin will put all LGBTQIA+ youth at continued risk for mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and suicide.

There are probably only 14 trans kids going into this school, and making it so that they have to be outed to their families who may not support them only puts these kids in danger. The 2021 model policy seemed just perfectly fine. It offered guidance on how to handle trans kids and it gave them the agency to handle their identity in the best way. This new policy is only going to open the door up for further harassment. There are homes out there that would be especially cruel and hostile to trans kids, and those kids need a place where they can feel safe and comfortable. They are going to school for an education, not to feel that they are in danger or that they’re in some big war zone. The schools need to be the safest possible environment possible for those kids, so that they can focus on getting a good education. These kids don’t need the schools or the government to go sticking their dirty fingers into their private lives because some misguided politicians think that they know best. This is ridiculous. It’s ghoulish. The teachers are there to teach not act like the trans snopes, out to nark on random kids.

Rob ,Strongly OPPOSE the 2022 guidance document,"The 2022 draft policies will erase trans and non-binary youth from the classroom and create a hostile and even dangerous school environment. They restrict restroom access and sports participation for transgender and nonbinary students, require faculty and staff to “out” trans and nonbinary students to their parents, and prohibit teachers and staff from supporting trans students in a range of ways, including blocking them from using a student’s affirming name and pronouns. Further, to require such parental notification even for the student's choice of a nickname is absurd.  Of course, all parents should be confident that our laws will ensure their children’s safety, protection, and freedom. But the Virginia Department of Education proposes to reject those values and to advance a policy that would target trans and non-binary kids for bullying and mistreatment just because of who they are. It is well-known and understood that some, if not many parents will abuse or even reject children who are ""outed"" by their teachers, school counselors or administrators.

Anonymous ,disgusting.,"(copy/pasted from my email to the governor. tw// suicide, cw// abortion, religion, & transphobia mentions.) Did you know that 40% of all transgender individuals attempt suicide in their lifetimes? As of 2022, about 1.5 million Americans identify as transgender--that's 640,000 lives on the line.The CDC reports that in 2019, 629,898 people had abortions.By these data, the transgender suicide rate nationwide is overall higher than the abortion rate.I don't understand how you can look the other way as 640,000 innocent people end their lives over something they cannot control, but fight to keep the number of abortions at 0. I am asking you to keep reading. This is a difficult pill to swallow, but ignoring this email is the difference between life and death for some trans people. Are you willing to risk their lives? The lives of children? According to the National Library of Medicine, ""The present study examines the influence of intervenable risk factors [...] and protective factors: school belonging, family support, and peer support on both lifetime suicide attempts and past 6-month suicidality in a sample of transgender youth (n = 372)."" This sentence explains that one of the major variables NLM studied was the impact of school belonging on transgender youth, indicating that it has a significant effect on them. It's not possible to determine the individual specific cause of suicide for every transgender person, of course, but we can deduce that school belonging has a large impact on transgender lives. Beyond the statistics, I have had personal experiences with suicide and suicidal thoughts. When I first suspected I may be transgender, I prayed to God every chance I could to take the thoughts away. He did not. On a personal note, I've considered killing myself because of my gender identity before. I have been given a suicide action plan. Your laws will only condemn me and hundreds of thousands of other transgender youth to pain at school and an increased risk of committing suicide.

It is wrong for schools and teachers to ""hide"" information from parents. Parents have a right to know what their children are doing in school, from their grades to their friends to everything. How can a mother or father or grandparent effectively parent their child without the knowledge of what is going on in that child's life? I have a 4 year old grandson about to begin pre-k, I have honestly considered homeschooling him due to the current policy and because I NEVER want my grandson to learn in school about transgender and non-binary and make a decision about his life without all of the information I believe he should have. I will love my grandson regardless of his chosen sexual orientation, I just don't think he is mature enough to make that decision in elementary school, especially without my guidance!!

Youngkin's roll back is dangerous and unacceptable on so many levels. Schools should be welcoming and inclusive, not exclusionary.  The main concern should be on students learning, and what we can do to ensure that they are getting the best educaiton. If, as folx have been saying, we need to get students caught back up because of pandemic learning, then we need to focus on that. Students who feel threatened or not welcomed, will not come to school creating an even larger learning deficit.  We are literally talking about life and death for some of these students. Recent surveys show that transgender and non-binary students are far more likely to commit suicide than other students. Much of the most recent data on this is from the Trevor Project and CDC, linked below. A quick google search will let you know how important it is to protect these youth who identify as Trans and Non-Binary AS WELL AS all of the other LGBTQ+ youth.   We owe them support, love, and dignity...not.",,9/26/22  10:45am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129600

Katherine ,Trans Rights are NOT Anti-Parent,"The new 2022 guidance regarding transgender students assumes that in order to support parents' rights, they have to be informed of all decisions pertaining to their child. We don't do this with other things - we don't get parental consent before serving children lunch or assigning homework or going outside to play. This isn't really about parents' rights at all - it's about limiting the ability of transgender students to be themselves, particularly when parents and caregivers are not supportive of their students. If a parent/caregiver were abusing their child, we wouldn't ask for consent before having them talk to a school psychologist. We would act in the best interest of the child - we would PROTECT the child. Yes, I am comparing not supporting a transgender student to abuse. There are consequences when transgender students don't feel the support and acceptance for who they are. There is research on this which the VDOE has completely ignored in their willingness to pander to a handful of right-wing politicians and extremists who feel that it is their job to suppress the rights of others.

"Fairfax Resident, Student, and Healthcare Provider ",Unacceptable targeting of an already at-risk population,"Transgender and gender non-conforming (GNC) youth face a disproportionately higher risk of negative physical and mental health impacts. These policies are in direct opposition to activist groups and educators who work daily to improve public education and address alarming gaps in inclusivity within our public institutions. As of 9/6/2022, at least 28 transgender individuals in the United States were recorded as victims in violent homicide cases. This number steadily grows as a result of hate, lack of education, and that of policies that fail to protect transgender and GNC youth as they seek to grow within our public education system. These policies WILL result in a significant increase of both in-public, institutional, and at-home harm for students. Forcing teachers and students into a constant dance of regulations will remove the limited protections that were in place for students that come to public institutions (i.e. students who have a lack of resources or face domestic violence in their homes). Inclusivity should be at the forefront of this discussion, and our governor should prioritize ALL youth that he claims to protect.    For information on inclusivity and anti-transgender violence, please read (it doesn't take a genius to use Google and find these sources):  https://www.hrc.org/news/hrc-mourns-dede-ricks-black-transgender-woman-killed-in-detroit https://vawnet.org/sc/serving-trans-and-non-binary-survivors-domestic-and-sexual-violence/violence-against-trans-and https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2021 https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/14054?autologincheck=redirected?nfToken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000    ",,9/26/22  10:49am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129626

This does not refer to how a public school must function. If parents want to dictate how their child thinks, behaves and is referred to then they must then invest in home schooling or any number of private schools that will indoctrinate these children to their way of thinking. This new set of guidelines will allow parents to bring their beliefs into the classrooms and usurp the authority of the teachers and administration by breaking the trust bond between the students and staff. As teachers and parents, it is our duty to raise children to be independent. It is our duty to raise people who can think for themselves and act accordingly. This new set of guidelines is a misguided attempt at indoctrinating our children to conform rather than be independent thinkers.

Robin Davis ,"Oppose This Cruel, Inhumane Policy That Will Harm Children","I strongly oppose this proposed policy that tramples the rights and safety of trans and gender-conforming students. In its zeal to protect the rights of parents Virginia is overlooking that schools ought to be focused on making sure that STUDENTS flourish. Forbidding students to express themselves and explore their gender identities without written permission from their parents and requiring schools and teachers to tell parents information that students wish to keep private is needlessly cruel and excessive government interference and red tape. The rights of parents do not supersede the rights of students. We should respect that students know their own families and home situations better than state legislators do; if a student has not shared sensitive information with their parents they likely have a REASON for that and their concerns should be respected.    This policy is going to get children hurt and killed if it goes into effect, both from self harm and psychological distress and from family abuse. Do not do this. ",129643,9/26/22  10:50am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129643
Kate Gilles ,Revisions will harm youth,"I am very concerned about the revisions to the Department of Education's Model Policy that revoke protections and support for transgender and gender non-conforming youth. These revisions create an environment of shame and hostility for gender diverse young people and compounds the risks they already face, including anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and isolation from peers and supportive adults. To be clear, those risks are not inherent to diverse gender identity but are a result of society's discrimination toward gender diverse people.  I urge Governor Youngkin and the Department of Education to repeal these revisions and instead institute a Model Policy that offers greater protections and support for all young people, including and especially those who are gender diverse. ",129644,9/26/22  10:50am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129644

Anonymous former Virginian ,Very strongly oppose because I love Virginia ,"I'm 54 years old, and grew up in Front Royal. I love the fields, rivers, the forests and mountains of my home. It broke my heart to love a place so much, and to be so unwelcome among the kids I grew up with, and victimized by parents and adults I’d never met. I was then, as now, transgender. I didn’t know other trans people existed until adulthood. Despite not having a name for it, or even understanding why, I was the target of slurs, bullying, and violence. Called a ‘,’ ‘queerbait,’ ‘cocksucker,’ starting in first grade. Teachers laughed, said they were praying for me, that I had to toughen up. I was pulled out of classes with other kids in 5th grade because one of the teachers didn’t want “that little  in my class.” They threatened to hold me back a year if I didn’t stop ‘acting like a girl.’ But the thing is, I wasn’t acting. That was almost forty years ago. I left home, transitioned- which for me was the beginning of a long, successful, and extremely happy life. But the scars of my first 18 years on this Earth are deep, and it hurts so deeply to know that the place I grew up has not only not changed, but that the cruelty I endured has been polished and made official state policy. ",129647,9/26/22  10:51am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129647

My child is nonbinary and though their journey to personal identity has been challenging, I cannot imagine how much more difficult it would have been without their 100% parental and school support through their adolescence. No child should have suicidal thoughts in our state because they fear acceptance from their community. This proposal makes the fear a reality and clearly states that anyone who is different is not accepted. Every person deserves the right to feel safe. Other people's comfort level is a non-issue in comparison to one person's actual physical safety. Trans kids are not rapists. Show me one evidence-based study that suggests that conclusion. Meanwhile, the research on the dangers trans kids face in an intolerant community are evident in the disproportionate numbers of suicide and self-harm that this group suffers. Educate yourself.

JM ,Strongly Agree with this new guidance,"I am not a Republican.  I am a lifelong Democrat.  Based on that, I'm told that I'm supposed to find this new guidance hateful.  However, I find myself strongly agreeing with this new guidance.  My school district in Central Virginia currently has policies stating that my middle school age child can change her name, pronouns, and gender at school all without me as a parent being notified if my child asks for this information to be kept from me.  Further, the policies in our school district state that they will give my child counseling to help her make these transitions, again without any notification to me as a parent if my child asks that I not be notified.  That is an absolutely insane policy.  At 12 years old, my child (and all children) lack the cognitive development to make these life changing decisions without my guidance.  My 12 year old thinks bed time should be a choice, that dessert is acceptable for dinner, that she should be able to go where she wants when she wants, and many other simple things that I as a parent must help guide and direct.  A life changing decision as important as altering gender is clearly something that as a parent, I need to be able to discuss with my child and provide guidance given the clearly not-fully-matured cognitive state present at this age.  The proper upbringing of my child is my parental right.  Schools do NOT have the right to keep important life decisions private from parents.   Further, with regard to bathroom and locker rooms, my district's policy currently states that students can use the facilities of preference and that alternative arrangements will be made for those who this makes uncomfortable.  This policy makes it clear that ""comfort"" is the driving issue.  But whose comfort should be respected?  If a private changing room is adequate for students made uncomfortable by a biological male entering a girls locker room, or a biological female entering a male locker room, than why is it not adequate for that student who is uncomfortable using the locker room matching his or her own biological gender?  Clearly, providing a private space to anyone uncomfortable with utilizing the facilities matching biological gender is a reasonable accommodation.  If this reasonable accommodation is not enough, than the only logical conclusion if we follow the current path to the end is to allow all students to utilize whatever locker room they choose regardless of biological or stated gender, or to remove locker rooms entirely and have all students change clothes out in the open.  Given that this topic is one of ""comfort"" and that somebody will be uncomfortable no matter what policy is put in place, the only logical path forward is to choose the policy that minimizes the number of uncomfortable individuals.  That path is to maintain division of facilities based on biological gender.",129658,9/26/22  10:53am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129658

"Beth O'Connor, Virginia Rural Health Association ",Virginia Must Increase Protective Factors for Students,"The Virginia Rural Health Association is troubled by the new guidelines announced by Governor Younkin that address parental rights for transgender students.  VRHA remains committed to the health and wellbeing of all rural Virginians, inclusive of mental health.  VRHA launched our Pride of Rural Virginia initiative last year and is aware that support and resources for LGBTQIA+ youth is harder to access in our rural communities.   The new guidelines state parents must be informed and given the opportunity to object before the school provides counseling services related to gender.  The implementation of this restriction will mean that parents who are unsupportive of their transgender child can refuse counseling services for the student.  Additionally, notifying the parents may increase the potential of a student being verbally or emotionally abused by a non-supportive parent.   The University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center recently released the policy brief “Key Informant Perspectives on Supporting Health and Well-Being for LGBTQ+ Rural Residents.”  That document outlines a number of barriers to health equity for our LGBTQIA+ citizens with lack of services and an unsupportive environment listed first.  “Discrimination is not uniquely rural, but when it happens in rural the impact is much more profound” stated one respondent.   The majority of Virginia’s rural communities are classified as Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas by the US Human Resources and Services Administration.  Virginia must increase protective factors that prevent mental health crisis for all community members.    Research suggests that among LGBTQ youth, only one-third experience parental acceptance, with an additional one-third experiencing parental rejection, and the final one-third not disclosing their LGBTQ identity until they are adults (Katz-Wise et al., 2015). Young adults who report high levels of parental rejection are eight times more likely to report attempting suicide and six times more likely to report high levels of depression (Ryan et al., 2009).   Many LGBTQ youth lack access to affirming spaces, with only 55% of LGBTQ youth reporting that their school is LGBTQ-affirming and only 37% saying that their home is LGBTQ-affirming. Fewer than 1 in 3 transgender and nonbinary youth found their home to be gender-affirming and a little more than half (51%) found their school to be affirming. The Trevor Project’s research consistently finds that LGBTQ young people report lower rates of attempting suicide when they have access to LGBTQ-affirming spaces.   In April of 2022, the Virginia Department of Health released the report, Self-Harm and Suicide Among Virginia Youth Aged 9-18 Years, 2015-2021.  While the report does not separate by sexual orientation or gender identity, it has a number of troubling statistics, including:   The Commonwealth of Virginia should work to reduce factors that lead to self-harm and suicide, particularly in rural areas where resources are limited.  Ideally, a student would have both supportive parents and a supportive school environment.  The new guidelines create an environment in which a student may not have either.",129686,9/26/22  10:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129686

I had hoped to make it to 40 but the stress of a political response to public health policy and the anxiety over policies enacted in my state with regard to “CRT”, transgender students being banned from sports and the restrictions on literature that disproportionately excludes the voices of Black authors, LGBTQ authors who are only quite recently even being published, the angry parents voices who scream that teachers are “groomers” - it all became far too much for me to endure in an increasingly thankless profession. Some of you may be delighted that you have driven me away, despite my having successfully taught the highest levels of mathematics, while earning advanced degrees (the only way we have to increase our salaries) and sending thousands of students on to the best universities with a foundation for success. I was openly gay throughout my career. I didn’t speak of it in the classroom but I stifled all racism, homophobia, or sexism as it occurred. My classroom was always a safe space. I also sponsored a Pride organization for LGBTQ+ students and I have come to know and advocate for hundreds of these students. We engendered a culture in my school that intentionally and proactively included LGBTQ students. This is not to say that we solved anything - there were still incidences of bullying and hatred, particularly to the most intersectional of our students. But, we had an administration with a consciousness around these issues and they were addressed. It wasn’t Utopia but every inch of progress is so deeply felt and appreciated by the students who are marginalized. What I cannot understand is what real threat you believe we present to your children. My Pride Coalition only asked to be accepted and respected. We weren’t handing toasters out in the cafeteria, trying to recruit people to become LGBTQ. We only wanted allies, to be heard, to see ourselves represented. Why is it so hard for you to just leave us alone?",129688,9/26/22  10:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129688
Catherine Casey MD ,Youngkin's proposed policy change violates civil rights and best practices in medicine.,"We are the healthcare professionals who take care of Virginia’s children and families, dedicating our lives to serving you and your children in your greatest moments of need. Rooted in our tenets of healing, beneficence, and self-determination, we are called to advocate for the transgender and gender-diverse youth for whom we care, who will be irreparably harmed if the proposed 2022 Model Policies on Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools comes into fruition.   Affirming a child’s gender identity, whether at home, at the doctor’s, or in school, is crucial to the child’s health and wellbeing. We know the statistics, that in 2021, over half of all transgender and gender-diverse youth considered killing themselves, and one in five attempted suicide.  But for us, these statistics are more than numbers; they are the names and faces and memories of children we’ve met and cared for. In their moments of hopelessness, we find hope together knowing that when a child’s identity and pronouns are honored, their suicidality lessens.   Unfortunately, the aforementioned proposed school policy enacts dangerous barriers to the safety of transgender and gender-diverse children. First, in mandating schools to inform unsupportive parents of their child’s identity, this policy obliterates the one affirming space a child may have and increases the risk of suicide and abuse by unnecessarily provoking parental hostility and rejection. Additionally, it bans any measure to affirm a child’s identity without written parental instruction by requiring school employees to use the student’s legal sex and name instead of affirming their pronouns and name. This extraordinarily harmful mandate has no legal basis. The referenced US Supreme Court cases of Troxel v Granville, Wisconsin v Yoder, and Pierce v Society of Sisters refer to matters of familial visitation and the right to withdraw from public school - not a parent’s right to deny their child’s identity and access to critical health services, such as gender counseling.   Furthermore, the proposed policy mandates students to participate in extracurricular activities and use bathrooms according to their assigned sex, despite legal precedent considering this unlawful discrimination.  In fact, this proposed policy eliminates every effort in its predecessor to create a nurturing and supportive environment, apathetic to the psychological and physical consequences to our transgender and gender-diverse youth. This policy claims that, “All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying,” yet persecutes children by denying them their identity. Any policy that directs teachers and staff to mistreat their students in this way is discriminatory at best and deadly at worst.   As Virginia’s healthcare workers, we are the ones who see children in emergency departments when they decide their lives aren’t worth living anymore, when the trauma in their bodies manifest as seizures or psychosis or debilitating pain. We are the ones who listen to these children weep as we try to convince them that their future is bright and real, that the bullying will one day be in the past, that acceptance of who they are will come. When we say that this proposed policy will devastate our children’s safety, we know from witnessing it ourselves. This policy will negatively impact the health and wellbeing of our children, leading to higher rates of suicide and self-harm, and we demand this proposal be denied.   ",129690,9/26/22  10:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129690
Sarah ,"Normalcy, transparency, decency and common sense back in schools","Transgender Identity has no place in our schools. This is between parent and child. With the sexual grooming, pornography, CRT, Equity issues in our daily classes it is no wonder our children can’t read. Leave our children out of this and turn these issues to the parents. Teach our children cursive writing, math, science, English, history. They don’t do homework any longer, books and we don’t see what they are doing. Secrets, secrets and more secrets. Give us transparency about their daily lessons. INVOLVE the parents! Leave our children alone and let them be children. Va Beach School Board has now decided that we are sharing our parental right with them! ",129691,9/26/22  10:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129691
Anonymous ,OPPOSED - Wasting tax dollars on needless gov overreach,"Of all the problems we could solve with a government system, THIS is what we choose to focus on? Not progress, improving quality of life, betterment of the state and its people. But instead bickering on who can call whom what? WE DO NOT PAY YOU TO WASTE OUR HARD-EARNED TAX DOLLARS ON NEEDLESS BUREAUCRATIC OVERREACH.  Stop thinking of creative ways to be cruel and divisive and do something useful for once! ",129692,9/26/22  10:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129692
Jeff S in Montgomery County ,Strongly Oppose the Proposal,"Protect our precious lgbtq kids! This proposal is a political stunt that will harm kids and teachers directly, and further fans the flames of far right political violence.

Deidra Thornton ,So unbelievably out of touch,"This bill is beyond the pale. Absolute rubbish. Trans kids have just as much right to their own bodily autonomy as any cis kid. Not only that, who are you to force exposure on some of the most marginalized people in this country. You, and your ilk, are the reason why the US is no longer that shining beacon on the hill. But, it will be these kids, that you so callously demean that will light that brazier up again, brighter than before.",129694,9/26/22  10:59am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129694
Caitlin McNiece ,I VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE THIS POLICY!,"If Republicans were actually pro life, they would be against this policy, too. The amount of children who commit suicide due to bullying for being different than their peers is truly devastating. Virginia schools should embrace our differences and be inclusive to all. Separation of church and state!  Virginia is for LOVERS! not HATERS!",129695,9/26/22  10:59am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129695
Erika ,This policy will kill children,"It is well documented that LGBTQ+ youth are significantly more likely to attempt suicide when they are in unsupportive environments. The policies proposed create an environment which is actively hostile to Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming youth, and will result in a higher occurrence of self harm. The current policies supporting and protecting trans youth are the policies which need to be kept in place. That is how you protect kids.",129696,9/26/22  10:59am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129696
Hillary W ,Strongly opposed changing the policies,Transgender students are a vulnerable group and should be protected! They are already often subject to bullying and sometimes have to hide their true selves for fear of backlash from their community. Schools should be a safe space where they can be seen for who they truly are and where they are free to express themselves safely!,129697,9/26/22  11:00am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129697
