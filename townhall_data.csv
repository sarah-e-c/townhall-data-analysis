Cassidy Moulton-Hill ,Protect Kids,This attempt to keep trans children from affirming their gender in the most vulnerable place they can be is a clear disregard for children’s lives and an attempt at nothing but conveying control over children with an extremely partisan belief. Trans children are more likely to commit suicide over cis children. To declare any type of protection for children and then disregarding their right to be and simply just use a bathroom (a place that should be of extremely little concern of adults) makes the original argument disingenuous at best. Protect children by allowing them the respect to make decisions regarding their own mental health and their decision to choose where to mind their own business without adults obsessing over their genitalia.,128948,9/26/22  12:30am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128948
"LH, Fairfax County Public Schools mother ",Wholly support the 2022 guidance,"I fully support the proposed 2022 Guidelines.  The 2021 Guidance put schools in the position of severing the parent-child relationship, of deciding what is best for a child and of unduly influencing a minor child.  While supportive schools are essential, and the rights of every student are equally important, parents know, love and care for their children far more than schools, which are transient in a child's life.  The previous 2021 guidance went far beyond State and Federal Law in wresting decision-making and authority away from parents and handing it over to schools and non-guardians.   This new guidance appropriately revokes the deceit authorized by the 2021 guidance, which in practice directed schools to conceal its interactions with a minor child, whether over counseling or use of pronouns, facilities etc. This deceitful aspect of the 2021 guidance was one of its most problematic and dangerous features. The previous guidance also cited and relied on resources only from ideological groups and smaller committees of medical professionals.  There is growing evidence, internationally and nationally, of harm from rushing children to gender transition, and the previous guidance fostered this by its complete omission of full research.  Most countries in Europe are moving away from the gender-affirming only approach, because of the accumulating evidence of harm to children.  Schools should never take on the role of influencing a child's sexuality or gender identity, and the previous guidance put schools in this position by an entirely one-sided approach to gender, rather than a balanced one as would be true of an evidence-based approach.   Additionally, the previous guidance put girls and women in harm's way by allowing males into all their safe spaces.  While the intent of the 2021 guidance is to allow transgender students to chose facilities, the practice in the way it is worded disallows questioning of any male entering a female space.  Further, the population of girls and women who have been victims of sexual assault is far greater than the population of transgender students, and it is wrong and dangerous for these women to have to fear males entering private spaces with them. There are reasonable and fair ways to protect transgender students without taking away the right to privacy and safety of every female in the system. Further, the former guidance unlawfully compelled speech as to pronoun usage, again going far beyond both State and federal law.  Every child deserves equal respect, but the law does not grant them the right to compel the speech of others. Every school will have to work out ways to respect and support transgender children, including for children who may face danger at home. It goes without question that support, compassion and respect are essential to caring for transgender children in schools. The answer, however, is not a blanket order affecting all families by unlawfully removing parental authority and involvement from a child's life, as was the effect of the previous guidance.  Schools and counselors should be partners with children and parents, not usurpers of parental roles. This policy is a great step forward in removing the excesses of the 2021 Guidance.",128949,9/26/22  2:37am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128949

Deb F ,Protect Kids,"Names matter and every kid deserves to be called by their chosen name without question. I moved to VA in the middle of kindergarten. My new teacher was an old bat named Mrs. Vannoy who insisted that all children be called by their proper names. My proper name was Deborah and despite my parents telling her that I went by Debbie, she refused to call me by that name. To this day, I still cringe a little when I hear people use it because I grew to hate my own name by a teacher who wouldn't listen. Furthermore, I knew how to spell Debbie but not Deborah so imagine being a kid in school who doesn't know how to spell your own name. As a teacher, I have kids that go by many names that aren't their own given name. Being a Southerner, most of my family goes by either a nickname or some other name like a middle name. I have friends who I don't know their real names because I've always known them by a nickname. NO ONE QUESTIONS THIS and they shouldn't. But if one day, if Amy wants to be known as Aiden or Michael wants to go by Chelle, it's suddenly harmful to the child - to use a name they chose. We need to stop this nonsense and use the money creating these bigoted bills (and the ensuing lawsuits) to do something really useful like give school staff raises, purchase school supplies, and fix crumbling school infrastructure.",128955,9/26/22  6:48am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128955

Parent nova ,100% support parental rights ,"100% yes. It is unlawful for Schools to take away parental rights. The high suicide rates with the transgender community are not because of the parents But rather because of the system failing a child, allowing the child to cut off their genitalia, and pursue a sex change at a very young age before the child has the sense that it is forever changing their future. Once the child realizes that they were pressured into an unalterable sex change, they will clearly be angry at the school system, their community, and their parents for failing them. A girl who has her breasts removed will never be able to nurse her children, and also worse may never be able to have children after the surgery. The fact that parents would not be involved in something so significant is criminal. This of course needs to change because parents to have rights despite what the school boards are pushing.",128957,9/26/22  6:54am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128957

No.  Bathrooms are a non-issue as well. Kids don't even get bathroom breaks these days anyway because schools are too concerned about vaping and fights. Stop this nonsense and tell parents if they want to be more involved in their kid's lives, they need to BE A PARENT and not demand that the schools do everything for them. They also need to spend time with their kids instead of yelling at school board meetings or complaining that teachers never tell them anything even though their kid has dozens of crumpled up notes from their teacher buried in their backpack.",128958,9/26/22  7:01am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128958

It hurts no one to call a child by their chosen name. As an early childhood educator, I learned whole school fulls of children's names, and some gasp were nicknames or even middle names.  It’s no longer acceptable to cram people into the box some small mind thinks they fit into, regardless of who they actually are, until they succumb to depression or anxiety or descend to the point of suicide. Every kid deserves a chance to reach their full potential, and for that to happen, they all need to feel equally safe in school.",128959,9/26/22  7:01am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128959

They should not be held responsible for remembering what someone chooses to be called. Parents need to be more active in these important decisions as that is their responsibility as a parent! Letting children choose encourages more ridiculousness like identifying as a cat or dog and this IS happening also. Where do we draw the line. When they leave the education system they can be whatever they choose but as long as they are under 18 parents are the deciding factor and let’s hope they have the good sense to be a sensible guidance to their child. ",128965,9/26/22  7:18am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128965

It seems all attention is being paid to leftist political theories, rather than academic rigor, and the failing performance of our schools, is evidence to this fact.

Gay Rights Activist and Parent ,U.S. History and the Virginia Code and Rule of Law Affirms Parental Rights,"I have been an active supporter of gay rights for over a decade and sat on a national board that helped to over turn ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" established by U.S. President Bill Clinton.  I also worked tirelessly to support civil marriage for all consenting adults. These were monumental changes in our society that made us a better nation.  That said, the current movement by educators and some politicians who are not board certified in mental health, gender dysphoria, and pediatric medicine is profoundly disturbing, unethical, and akin to medical malpractice.  There is a bright line between adult decisions and parental rights and the law in Virginia is quite clear and is based on thousands of years of culture and human history writ large: § 1-240.1. Rights of parents. A parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent's child.  The attempt by some to separate parents from their minor children is chilling and dangerous.  It is what Stalin attempted to do in the Soviet Union, Pol Pot did in Cambodia, and what the Chinese Communist Party is current doing to the  Uyghur children. Educators and politicians who want to separate minor children claim parents will abuse or harm children who may have gender dysphoria. Every educator and person who works with minor children is legally responsible to be a mandatory reporter so that all children are safe. Mandatory reporters are not to keep secrets with minor children from their parents.  If they suspect abuse they must immediately report that claim to law enforcement. There are laws on the books and training for all mandatory reporters to go to law enforcement so this argument is moot.  Think about this for a moment - how would you feel if a teacher gave razor blades to a minor child who is cutting themselves to ""affirm"" their affliction?  Or if a teacher helped an anorexic girl get fat removed from her body to ""affirm"" her affliction?  Affirming any mental health crisis without being board certified and without parental permission is caustic and destructive behavior.  It is insanity.  A child in Virginia schools cannot take an Tylenol without parental consent and yet some elected officials want to put the burden on educators to be a board certified medical professional. That is not only unethical it is illegal. To that end, this policy makes sense.  Removing parents from their legal responsibility to make decisions for their minor child by the school system is illegal and morally reprehensible.  This policy is on solid legal and moral footing and reaffirms parental rights in Virginia while supporting all children and ensuring educators are reminded they are educators and not medical professionals.  ",,9/26/22  8:08am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128988

Anonymous ,Strongly Oppose The Changes ,"Correct pronoun and name use is incredibly critical to the mental and physical health of transgender students. The proposed changes to this law threaten that health and safety, by only allowing students who feel comfortable sharing their gender identity with their parents the right of being treated with the respect of their correct name and pronouns. There are hundreds of reasons a child might not feel comfortable sharing this with their parents - religion, politics, or even just not being ready to share with their family yet. The argument that parents have the right to raise their children themselves is nonsensical, as it implied that teachers are somehow forcing a gender identity onto trans kids by respecting their pronouns. Moreover, children request to be called different names than their legal name all the time. Will we need parental consent to call William Will, or to call someone who prefers their middle name by it? This proposed change unfairly targets transgender children, and will have dire consequences for their health and wellbeing in schools if enacted.   ",128992,9/26/22  8:12am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128992
Tracey Marek ,strongly oppose this policy,"Having worked with students in both middle and high schools in Virginia for 26 years this policy will only cause damage.

The previous policies PROTECTED all students, this new policy targets transgender youth in a very negative way. We already have a mental health crisis in youth and now you want us to obtain written statements from parents telling us what name to use for their children? Do you not understand that most of these children are NOT out to their parents yet for fear of abuse, disownment, harassment etc.? This is not a whim or choice, only about 2% of transgender students ever change back to cisgender.

Anonymous ,Opposition to new transgender policy,"I strongly oppose the new transgender policy. The policy purports to be aimed at supporting parental rights. However, it actually makes it harder and more burdensome for parents to support their children who already are dealing with tough issues by unrealistically and unnecessarily requiring them to provide legal documents to support use of different pronouns for their child. Further the policy requiring students to use the bathrooms that correspond to their gender assigned at birth is harmful mentally and physically to students. The department’s policies should be about its STUDENTS and their well-being. Instead the new policy is about a politician scoring points with a constituency.

Cassidy Moulton-Hill ,Protect Kids,This attempt to keep trans children from affirming their gender in the most vulnerable place they can be is a clear disregard for children’s lives and an attempt at nothing but conveying control over children with an extremely partisan belief. Trans children are more likely to commit suicide over cis children. To declare any type of protection for children and then disregarding their right to be and simply just use a bathroom (a place that should be of extremely little concern of adults) makes the original argument disingenuous at best. Protect children by allowing them the respect to make decisions regarding their own mental health and their decision to choose where to mind their own business without adults obsessing over their genitalia.,128948,9/26/22  12:30am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128948
"LH, Fairfax County Public Schools mother ",Wholly support the 2022 guidance,"I fully support the proposed 2022 Guidelines.  The 2021 Guidance put schools in the position of severing the parent-child relationship, of deciding what is best for a child and of unduly influencing a minor child.  While supportive schools are essential, and the rights of every student are equally important, parents know, love and care for their children far more than schools, which are transient in a child's life.  The previous 2021 guidance went far beyond State and Federal Law in wresting decision-making and authority away from parents and handing it over to schools and non-guardians.   This new guidance appropriately revokes the deceit authorized by the 2021 guidance, which in practice directed schools to conceal its interactions with a minor child, whether over counseling or use of pronouns, facilities etc. This deceitful aspect of the 2021 guidance was one of its most problematic and dangerous features. The previous guidance also cited and relied on resources only from ideological groups and smaller committees of medical professionals.  There is growing evidence, internationally and nationally, of harm from rushing children to gender transition, and the previous guidance fostered this by its complete omission of full research.  Most countries in Europe are moving away from the gender-affirming only approach, because of the accumulating evidence of harm to children.  Schools should never take on the role of influencing a child's sexuality or gender identity, and the previous guidance put schools in this position by an entirely one-sided approach to gender, rather than a balanced one as would be true of an evidence-based approach.   Additionally, the previous guidance put girls and women in harm's way by allowing males into all their safe spaces.  While the intent of the 2021 guidance is to allow transgender students to chose facilities, the practice in the way it is worded disallows questioning of any male entering a female space.  Further, the population of girls and women who have been victims of sexual assault is far greater than the population of transgender students, and it is wrong and dangerous for these women to have to fear males entering private spaces with them. There are reasonable and fair ways to protect transgender students without taking away the right to privacy and safety of every female in the system. Further, the former guidance unlawfully compelled speech as to pronoun usage, again going far beyond both State and federal law.  Every child deserves equal respect, but the law does not grant them the right to compel the speech of others. Every school will have to work out ways to respect and support transgender children, including for children who may face danger at home. It goes without question that support, compassion and respect are essential to caring for transgender children in schools. The answer, however, is not a blanket order affecting all families by unlawfully removing parental authority and involvement from a child's life, as was the effect of the previous guidance.  Schools and counselors should be partners with children and parents, not usurpers of parental roles. This policy is a great step forward in removing the excesses of the 2021 Guidance.",128949,9/26/22  2:37am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128949

Deb F ,Protect Kids,"Names matter and every kid deserves to be called by their chosen name without question. I moved to VA in the middle of kindergarten. My new teacher was an old bat named Mrs. Vannoy who insisted that all children be called by their proper names. My proper name was Deborah and despite my parents telling her that I went by Debbie, she refused to call me by that name. To this day, I still cringe a little when I hear people use it because I grew to hate my own name by a teacher who wouldn't listen. Furthermore, I knew how to spell Debbie but not Deborah so imagine being a kid in school who doesn't know how to spell your own name. As a teacher, I have kids that go by many names that aren't their own given name. Being a Southerner, most of my family goes by either a nickname or some other name like a middle name. I have friends who I don't know their real names because I've always known them by a nickname. NO ONE QUESTIONS THIS and they shouldn't. But if one day, if Amy wants to be known as Aiden or Michael wants to go by Chelle, it's suddenly harmful to the child - to use a name they chose. We need to stop this nonsense and use the money creating these bigoted bills (and the ensuing lawsuits) to do something really useful like give school staff raises, purchase school supplies, and fix crumbling school infrastructure.",128955,9/26/22  6:48am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128955

The high suicide rates with the transgender community are not because of the parents But rather because of the system failing a child, allowing the child to cut off their genitalia, and pursue a sex change at a very young age before the child has the sense that it is forever changing their future. Once the child realizes that they were pressured into an unalterable sex change, they will clearly be angry at the school system, their community, and their parents for failing them. A girl who has her breasts removed will never be able to nurse her children, and also worse may never be able to have children after the surgery. The fact that parents would not be involved in something so significant is criminal.

Gay Rights Activist and Parent ,U.S. History and the Virginia Code and Rule of Law Affirms Parental Rights,"I have been an active supporter of gay rights for over a decade and sat on a national board that helped to over turn ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" established by U.S. President Bill Clinton.  I also worked tirelessly to support civil marriage for all consenting adults. These were monumental changes in our society that made us a better nation.  That said, the current movement by educators and some politicians who are not board certified in mental health, gender dysphoria, and pediatric medicine is profoundly disturbing, unethical, and akin to medical malpractice.  There is a bright line between adult decisions and parental rights and the law in Virginia is quite clear and is based on thousands of years of culture and human history writ large: § 1-240.1. Rights of parents. A parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent's child.  The attempt by some to separate parents from their minor children is chilling and dangerous.  It is what Stalin attempted to do in the Soviet Union, Pol Pot did in Cambodia, and what the Chinese Communist Party is current doing to the  Uyghur children. Educators and politicians who want to separate minor children claim parents will abuse or harm children who may have gender dysphoria. Every educator and person who works with minor children is legally responsible to be a mandatory reporter so that all children are safe. Mandatory reporters are not to keep secrets with minor children from their parents.  If they suspect abuse they must immediately report that claim to law enforcement. There are laws on the books and training for all mandatory reporters to go to law enforcement so this argument is moot.  Think about this for a moment - how would you feel if a teacher gave razor blades to a minor child who is cutting themselves to ""affirm"" their affliction?  Or if a teacher helped an anorexic girl get fat removed from her body to ""affirm"" her affliction?  Affirming any mental health crisis without being board certified and without parental permission is caustic and destructive behavior.  It is insanity.  A child in Virginia schools cannot take an Tylenol without parental consent and yet some elected officials want to put the burden on educators to be a board certified medical professional. That is not only unethical it is illegal. To that end, this policy makes sense.  Removing parents from their legal responsibility to make decisions for their minor child by the school system is illegal and morally reprehensible.  This policy is on solid legal and moral footing and reaffirms parental rights in Virginia while supporting all children and ensuring educators are reminded they are educators and not medical professionals.  ",,9/26/22  8:08am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128988

Anonymous ,Strongly Oppose The Changes ,"Correct pronoun and name use is incredibly critical to the mental and physical health of transgender students. The proposed changes to this law threaten that health and safety, by only allowing students who feel comfortable sharing their gender identity with their parents the right of being treated with the respect of their correct name and pronouns. There are hundreds of reasons a child might not feel comfortable sharing this with their parents - religion, politics, or even just not being ready to share with their family yet. The argument that parents have the right to raise their children themselves is nonsensical, as it implied that teachers are somehow forcing a gender identity onto trans kids by respecting their pronouns. Moreover, children request to be called different names than their legal name all the time. Will we need parental consent to call William Will, or to call someone who prefers their middle name by it?

However, it actually makes it harder and more burdensome for parents to support their children who already are dealing with tough issues by unrealistically and unnecessarily requiring them to provide legal documents to support use of different pronouns for their child. Further the policy requiring students to use the bathrooms that correspond to their gender assigned at birth is harmful mentally and physically to students. The department’s policies should be about its STUDENTS and their well-being. Instead the new policy is about a politician scoring points with a constituency. This is cruel and will have detrimental consequences for children—all we should care about. ",128994,9/26/22  8:13am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=128994

Christopher Meade ,I oppose this policy,"I am strongly against this attack on transgender people. If a student prefers to be called by a nick name in school, there is no problem (my name is Christopher but I preferred Chris and my teachers accommodated this). Calling a student by there preferred name is just basic respect and that should include trans students.    Also, outing transgender students can lead to violence/abuse against them and can impact their mental health which could lead to self harm and suicide.    Trans students should feel safe to be themselves just like every other student. This policy is blatant discrimination and, on a practical note, will be almost impossible to enforce. I know several teachers who have said they fully intend to ignore this policy when it is passed. Its nothing more than a ridiculous political stunt meant to appease the worst parts of the republican base.

Anonymous ,Protecting the emotional support offered to all students.,"Each student is entitled to emotional support from the school district they attend.  Ignoring the rights of transgender students is detrimental to their social and emotional growth as a young person.  By supporting the existing law concerning these rights, students can continue to grow in their journey to adulthood with the help of a caring and supportive school environment. In situations where students families do not accept or are not comfortable with their child’s decisions, perhaps resources can be made available to help them on their journey to learn more about the topic and how it applies to their situation. Threatening to kick a child out of the house or refusing to pay for college is certainly not helpful. The link between school and home is strong and anything to help bridge the transition to accepting a child’s transgender journey should be explored. Above all, protecting the student’s emotional well being must be a priority. Changing the existing law does not achieve that goal. ",129002,9/26/22  8:29am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129002

Especially people who have never talked to transgender kids or families of transgender kids,read the actual data from the America Academy of Pediatrics or just felt like most parents want what is best for their kids. My kid is not a political stand; my kid is not trying to pollute, groom, or corrupt your child. My child wants to go to school, use the bathroom and not be harassed regularly for who he is. Where are my parental rights in this policy? Where are my child’s rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? Policies such as this will end the lives of transgender children. It will put a group already at risk into more danger. Additionally, there isn’t a magic wand of declaring a minor is transgender and immediately that child is “mutilated”. The transition period with medical intervention is not immediate or done lightly. No parent I know has taken medical transition lightly. We are not stupid. We want to do what is best for OUR kid and do what keeps them ALIVE. Sometimes those decisions lead to surgery sometimes not. Some transgender people NEVER even want surgery. There is not a one size fits all to being trans. This policy is a direct reaction to fear and misunderstanding and willful ignorance and intentional fear mongering. It is wrong. It is judgement without basis in fact. Furthermore, go to a typical public school. You will not see trans kids taking over or teachers shoving gender issues down anyone’s throat. Teachers have enough on their plates and simply (most) just want their students to succeed no matter their gender.

 Counselor ,Strongly OPPOSE ,"September 26, 2022 The Virginia School Counselor Association (VSCA) opposes the Virginia Department of Education’s 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools as they are currently proposed. The 2022 model policies create barriers to privacy, dignity, and respect for Virginia’s students and seek to undermine previous legislation (i.e., § 22.1-23.3. Treatment of transgender students; policies) that works to create safe and supportive environments for our most vulnerable youth.  VSCA recognizes that: 56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020). Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for transgender males and 149% for transgender females (Murchison et al., 2019). 28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020). Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked out or abused (Thoma, 2021). Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022). Virginia school counselors work to remove barriers and support the social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. VSCA Ends Policies state that “Virginia School Counselors are committed to working with and advocating for marginalized groups, promote the mental health and wellness of all students, adhere to the ASCA Ethical Standards for School Counselors, and actively work to dismantle destructive systemic inequities.” Additionally, Virginia school counselors follow the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Position Statement on The School Counselor and Transgender and Nonbinary Youth (Adopted 2016, revised 2022) that states:  School counselors work to safeguard the well-being of transgender and nonbinary youth. School counselors recognize all students have the right to be treated equally and fairly, with dignity and respect as unique individuals, free from discrimination, harassment and bullying based on their gender identity and gender expression. Finally, Virginia school counselors seek to create environments that are not only inclusive and equitable for all students, including our transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students, but that celebrate the full scope of their identities, allowing them to thrive and reach their fullest potential. Furthermore, Virginia school counselors commit to dismantling any and all forms of inequity in Virginia’s public education system and fully support LGBTQ+ students. Every Virginia student, regardless of their gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation, has a right to learn free from discrimination and harassment. Against this background, it is VSCA’s stance that the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools are empirically unfounded and are not in accordance with evidence-based best practices concerning the treatment of transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students.",,9/26/22  8:37am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129014

Eric Bonnell ,"Parents, not governmental institutions, raise children ","Political agenda has no place in the school. Parents have the responsibility and therefore the autonomy to choose what they see fit for their children to learn. Ethical and religious decisions are the parents to make. School administrators and teachers are meant to teach children the mechanics they need to understand the world and come to their own conclusions as the come of age. I am very glad that my child is past the school age and  not imposed upon by those with an agenda that bullies children into a single mindset that divides them against others. Diversity applies to all and the Constitution acknowledges that. The issues of slavery and gender are being discussed as if people today have caused the problem. When Fred Rogers was on television, he taught Diversity as a strength and not a dividing issue. Parents had the choice to turn off the television or change the channel  if they disagreed with his message. Parents should have the same power with the schools. Government has no place in these issues; public schools are failing because they are administered by people who are not true educators. True educators build up children for success and do not leverage them as pawns to push a political agenda. Anyone, regardless of political affiliation, who teaches children need to assess the appropriateness of topics for the developmental age of the children, with parental approval, and in areas where it is appropriate to bring a topic into the classroom, children should be given the spectrum of thought on the topic and work with their parents to decide their opinion on that topic. Teach diversity as a strength and teach children that they all have different traits that can be used for good if they work together. Teach children to appreciate differences of traits and opinions, and to use them to build a better world.",129037,9/26/22  8:52am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129037
L E Pugh ,What a piece of politically-motivated tripe,"Dear Virginia Department of Education , I just read your 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents in Virginia Public Schools. I must say, it seems to be misnamed. Nowhere in this document is the privacy, dignity, or respect of the student addressed. There is a lot of information on what rights parents have. There is a lot of “peers shouldn’t bully peers” and “this is what cyberbullying looks like”, but nowhere is there any consideration given to the student’s rights, dignity, or access to personal development/exploration. Your introduction says, “As a part of that work, educators strive to meet the individual needs of all students entrusted to their care, and teachers work to create educational environments where all students thrive. The Virginia Department of Education... recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students.” It should be followed up with “but we’re here to destroy this in the name of the parents.” Nowhere is there anything that addresses what to do when these things come into conflict. Nowhere is there any guidelines of what to do for conflict-resolution. Everything says, “the parent’s word goes,” which is stupid and naive. According to you, parents are gods and goddesses, since this document does not seriously consider the needs or mental health of the child. It doesn’t look into the issues transgender youth deal with. Students don’t usually thrive when their parents are controlling them at a distance. Parents aren’t mental health professionals, and shouldn’t be assumed to be such. Rarely, especially in middle and high school, do parents understand their kids. The teachers and counselors should be able to judge whether a situation is safe to raise the issue. It shouldn't be a blanket requirement. Few parents can talk freely with their kids about such sensitive sex/gender topics; mostly because they’ve made their opinions quite clear, and kids don’t want to deal with it, risk it, or disappoint their parents. Or because the parents don’t like talking about it, or can’t really discuss it short of throwing around religious slogans or trite phrases. Don’t assume the ideal situation is the reality. It rarely is. Also of note, is the noticeable lack of “transgender”-specific school-related content or anything that might show that you looked at the other side of the argument. Very few of the documents you quote address the specific concerns and problems faced by transgender youth. None of the Resources even address transgender specifically or exclusively. It’s almost like you don’t want to look at what you should be doing to help this community. None of your arguments talk about what happens when parents hurt their children with their intractability. None of your own explanation of the rules even mentions transgender youth problems. You don't address issues with suicide and depression. Since this involves that group of people, shouldn’t some text about it be included? You don’t even recognize a student as “transgender” unless their parent agrees with it. Which is a pretty big problem, since if parents agree with their children’s alignment or lack of it, there are not issues. Which “9,000+ comments submitted to the Department during the public comment period in 2021” did you look at? How many were from ticked off parents and religious leaders? Were any from the children themselves or their supporters? This whole thing is to justify a horrible rule that eliminates a vital support system, and undercuts the whole purpose of counseling. Therapists and counselors are not required to tell parents everything they talked about with the student/patient. Teachers often have that role too. Parents aren’t always the best determiners of what their child actually needs. They often are blinded by what they want their child to be, how they expect children of a certain sex to act, or how their own upbringing might make them think. If the 14th Amendment and parents’ rights are so overarching, why do we have CPS or any child-protection laws? Could it be that parents aren’t the perfect arbiters of morals that this document implies? If students are to be treated as individuals, so should parents. Making it a requirement to let parents know everything ignores the fact that the student (the person the school should be focused on, whom it is the school’s duty to partly raise) might not be able to talk to their parents about things. So, you’re saying, teachers can’t protect kids from their abusive parents. They can’t be confidantes or supporters that can help them without letting their parents know. They can’t use their best judgment in dealing with issues. Really? Why should a trained professional’s professional ethics and experience be superseded by a parent’s preference? I’d say most of this document frames this as a “religious rights” issue, which it isn’t. If parents’ religious beliefs can decide what a student learns in a public school (which affects a lot of non-believers), when will we stop teaching earth science, evolution, and the sun-centric solar system because it might tick off the creationists? We’re already removing real history because some parents object. We’ve killed most informative sex education because some parents disapprove. If the parents object so vehemently, maybe they should home-school or send them to religious schools. That is what the “parents right to determine education” really means. When did we stop listening to people who actually studied education? The minute you contact “social services” for suicidal trans or gay kids with abusive parents, guess what? The parents are informed, which is what the kids don’t need. According to you, the parents should be able to raise their kids how they want… so guess what the social services is likely to do? Defer to the parents. There needs to be a middle ground, based on circumstances. There needs to be some way a kid can get help from teachers or counselors privately. Because sometimes that help guides them to understand their parents and see what they might be missing. Making teachers etc. essentially informants removes that guidance, making the children suspicious, paranoid, and unwilling to ask for help. So, according to this guidance, teachers and school administrators can bully trans-kids. Peers can't. None of your high-sounding language about protecting kids from bullying takes into account that demanding they are called certain pronouns is bullying. It’s insisting they conform in a way that damages them psychologically. Same thing with dress codes. Even you admit that legally, gender dysphoria is a “disability”. That means accommodations must be made, and calling them a different pronoun or name is hardly “excessive” or “an undue burden”. That is the yardstick you’re supposed to use. Or are you trying to use the ableist argument that since they are “disabled” they can be controlled even more, that their needs should be ignored if their caregiver decides it? Which isn’t what that decision means, and directly contradicts Code of Virginia, § 2.2-3900, et seq., which you also quote. Honestly, the only thing I liked in this whole document was the suggested policy that required single-person bathrooms be available in reasonable numbers. I think Grimm v Glouchester and Williams v. Kincaid are the only times you mention transgender people in any sort of supportive way. Everything else defends parents and the rights of a teacher to offend and abuse the students. “Parent engagement in school” doesn’t mean they have veto power, and it doesn’t mean the students should be reported on. It means that when a parent forms a partnership with the teachers, when they take a positive active role in their kid’s learning, the kids react well. It shouldn’t mean they can get books banned arbitrarily. It doesn’t mean they are the captain of the ship either. “Parental engagement” also depends on the parent. Some parents are extremely toxic, not only to their kids, but the school, teachers, and community. But they should be given free rein to form policy and instruction? Few of the parents that want this ever engage with schools in a partnership way. They regard schools and teachers with suspicion. Nowhere are the wants and needs of the student even addressed. Nowhere is there any expectation of parents listening to or interacting with teachers in any way that isn’t dictatorial. Beyond a “partnership goal"". Where they officially have the right to “review and comment” on things like books and instruction, you give them the power to stop it all together. Laws meant to prevent the release of information, you take as proof that parents can do whatever they want. According to you they have total “control” over their kids. Which is pretty r/insaneparents actually. The statutes you quote about privacy say parents have the right to “review” and “alter” official records. In other words, no one else should be able to do that. That has nothing to do with what goes on in a classroom, how teachers/peers etc. address students. It has nothing to do with how the child refers to themselves. So why is this used to justify a parent having to officially agree to what their child is called by a teacher? A lot of the laws you quote are meant to prevent/do one thing, but you claim they do another. You expand their reach beyond their purview or twist what they mean to say. The mere fact that you do this proves that this is a document of ideology not real policy. And if schools or state institutions try to push ideology, that’s bad, right? Especially if it’s harmful to the students’ mental, emotional, and physical well-being. How do you not see how contradictory these three suggested policy items are? Or is this that ridiculous “you’re only transgender if your parents say you are” thing?: “1. Every effort should be made to ensure that a transgender student wishing to change his or her means of address is treated with respect, compassion, and dignity in the classroom and school environment. 2. [School Division] personnel shall refer to each student using only (i) the name that appears in the student’s official record, or (ii) if the student prefers, using any nickname commonly associated with the name that appears in the student’s official record. 3. [School Division] personnel shall refer to each student using only the pronouns appropriate to the sex appearing in the student’s official record — that is, male pronouns for a student whose legal sex is male, and female pronouns for a student whose legal sex is female. How is that showing respect, compassion or dignity to the student? So, basically, what your document is saying is “Schools shall respect all students” and “Schools shall serve all students” but not really. Because when what the student’s needs conflicts with the parent’s desires, “Schools shall defer to parents to make the best decisions with respect to their children”. No debate, no exceptions. Parents rule. Which is stupid and dangerous, as well as extremely contradictory with what you say elsewhere. You pay lip-service to caring about the children, but you don’t allow them to be themselves. You frame this as being reasonable, but it’s not. You offer excuse after excuse on why you are “obligated” to kowtow to parents at the expense of their children. You don’t address the needs of the students with gender dysphoria, or how “sex-based sports participants are restricted according to biological sex” goes against Williams v. Kincaid. This is VA DOE mostly washing their hands of a complicated situation, claiming they can't interfere. It is stupid, cruel and short-sighted. But what else should I expect from a department that thinks “divisive issues” like slavery, negative history, gender issues, and sexual orientation should be banned from schools. When is science going to be considered “divisive?” Certain facts and theories certainly contradict religious doctrine. Will it fall to “religious freedom” too? If you can’t teach the facts, what’s the point of education? If you can’t support the mental health of students who should not be discriminated against according to the law, how can you claim to “care about all students”? How can you help a student thrive by insisting that he or she be called names and pronouns that give them dysphoria and make them suicidal? How can you claim to be non-discriminatory when your teachers, administrators, etc. model discriminatory, disrespectful, and bullying behavior in front of their students? What does that tell the other students about what is “acceptable behavior” to those with gender dysphoria? And why can’t people given the task of running a Department of Education not see the problem here? I know this is long, but you gave me a lot to work with. In brief, this policy stinks and does only half of what it claims to be written to do. And none of that helps the student, just the parents. And just remember, these students are going to be voters, some of them really soon. -- L. E. P.

"David Gorman, Professional School Counselor ",Strongly Oppose ,"56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality.

"Lorraine Dresch, Waynesboro Public Schools ",Strongly OPPOSE New Model Policies,"I am a representative of the Waynesboro High School Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, a group of educators dedicated to making the school a safe and welcoming environment for students of historically-marginalized backgrounds.   I would like to raise serious concerns regarding these model policies.  At WHS, there are approximately 90 transgender and gender-expansive students. These policies would directly negatively impact their daily lives by denying them the ability to safely express themselves and be affirmed for who they are. These students are deserving of protection and support. The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the new model policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a crucial form of suicide prevention.  Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: Transgender youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in part because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by caregivers due to their trans identity. The Trevor Project states that “38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth reported housing instability and homelessness.” By requiring educators such as teachers and guidance counselors to automatically inform parents of their child’s transgender identity if the student comes out at school, the state puts young people in a position where they must either suppress their identities entirely or risk the roof over their heads.  In summary, these new policies would in reality deny students the privacy, dignity, and respect they deserve. Schools have an important role in supporting the mental health and safety of their transgender and nonbinary students. As an educator dedicated to creating learning environments where everyone can thrive, I urge you to reject or at the very least substantially revise these model policies to protect trans youth.  Sincerely, Lorraine Dresch, Waynesboro High School Teacher https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2020/?section=Introduction  https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Trevor-Project-Homelessness-Report.pdf",,9/26/22  9:01am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129057

Mr. Youngkin: As Governor of an entire state, you have a responsibility to govern for ALL Virginians, whether they voted for you or not. This is not limited to only the people who share your personal views - or to benefit your long-term political goals.  Please consider that a year into your role as Governor, your aim should be to support Virginians, not to make vulnerable communities and young students feel more marginalized. These hurtful proposed policies could have serious negative impacts on young children for years to come. The long-term effects of not feeling accepted as who you are during a vulnerable time in your life will not go away in the short-term.",129074,9/26/22  9:08am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129074

But the Virginia Department of Education is rejecting those values and advancing a policy that would target trans and non-binary kids for bullying and mistreatment just because of who they are. The proposed policies seek to erase trans and non-binary youth from the classroom and create a hostile and even dangerous school environment. They restrict restroom access and sports participation for transgender and nonbinary students, require faculty and staff to “out” trans and nonbinary students to their parents, and prohibit teachers and staff from supporting trans students in a range of ways, including blocking them from using a student’s affirming name and pronouns. The effect can be devastating to these youth -- not only increasing the incidence of bullying, but increasing depressions and other mental health issues and possibly even suicide.

Krista Martin ,LGBT Mom of LGBT Children Supports This Measure ,"Let me begin by saying that I am an openly gay mother of several openly gay children that I would give my last breath for. I have been very active in their school life since 2009 when my oldest began kindergarten in Spotsylvania. I have not always agreed with things that have happened in their schools, eg; taking away Spanish as an elective, using the taking away of playground time as a form of punishment, to name a few, but I stand by the staff at my children’s schools because I come from a long line of teachers myself and I have seen first hand the love and dedication it takes to be an educator. That being said, those educators are not my children’s parents, I am.  Those teachers are not their healthcare providers, the medical teams I have carefully selected over 19 years and have been charged with giving the level of care my children need, are. They are also not the therapists or psychiatrists in charge of my children’s mental health, again, the team I selected and they agree to, are. If there is an issue I need to be made aware of, especially when the consequences of keeping it a secret could be life altering, it is my right as a parent to know so that I can go to the medical teams and address it with the appropriate authorities so my children can receive the care they need. While I understand not every parent is as understanding and loving as myself and my husband, I still believe it is the parents right and the schools obligation to inform parents  of concerns involving their children, from poor grades, bullying, to medical concerns. I also understand that there are concerns of potential abuse stemming from “outing” a child, I take them seriously as we all should, but school administrators, teachers, and guidance staff are all trained court mandated reporters. This means the door will open for getting children out of homes that are dangerous for them. As Virginians we should be concerned for a movement that seeks to keep parents for being involved in their children’s lives, especially considering how some counties have covered up sexual assaults or other issues like riots and large scale fights among other things. Where does it stop? When do parental rights end and those of the educational system begin?",129107,9/26/22  9:15am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129107

Annette Fritz ,This is an attempt to harm students and schools ,"Students are NOT solely the property of their parents and do have rights granted to them that Virginia is attempting to ignore. It is NOT the responsibility of schools to out queer students to parents; if parents have put any work into their relationship with their children, than they would know already if their child wants to use different names. The parents who applaud this expect the school to take over their parental responsibility to build a relationship with their kids. Furthermore, if most who want this policy actually spent time in school activities with their kids, they’d find out very quickly what their child is going by and their child’s thoughts. This is the government overreaching into schools for parents too lazy to actually parent their child and create a loving environment at home for their own children.  It will also place undue burden on teachers and open the schools for liability when a name is forgotten to be passed on or a parent accuses an unknowing teacher of hiding a name that the kid told their friends, but never explicitly told the teacher.  For the kids who will be outed to unsupportive or bigoted parents, the results can end in death, homelessness, and physical or emotional abuse. Studies show repeatedly that queer kids are not inherently more likely to be suicidal than their peers EXCEPT when faced with unsupportive family or school environments. Per the Trevor Project and the UCLA and Williamson Center, students in supportive environments fair significantly better than students who are forced into unsafe and unsupportive environments.  Stop using children and public education as pawns in your political games.

Respecting every individual is not hard to do and can be accomplished with the original model policies that the General Assembly and the last administration put together.   The actual studies around transgender/non-binary school policies does not support the bathroom and sports policies that this administration is proposing.  These policies prohibit access and/or participation in activities consistent with their gender identity without real evidence that any other children are harmed by inclusion. Hiding transphobia and hatred of what is different from what you consider the norm behind some vague notion of parental choice is absurd.  These policies are an intrusion into families' choices, not a support for each parent making choices for how they raise their children.  It is laughable to call these supportive of parental choice.  I implore the Board of Education to reject these reject these policies as they are fueled by hatred and do the exact opposite of what they claim to do--they restrict parents choices on how to raise their children and make it harder for teachers and faculty to support parental choice for parents of transgender and non-binary children.",129117,9/26/22  9:18am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129117

Alex Weathersby ,No Rollback on Transgender Students Rights,"As a constituent of Charlottesville City, alum of Albemarle County Schools, sexual/domestic violence preventionist, and queer adult, I wholeheartedly disagree with the proposed changes to this policy. Transgender students deserve to be safe.   Having one’s name and pronouns accepted is a well-researched method of lowering suicide risk in transgender youth (Bailey et al., 2014; Bauer et al., 2015a; Haas et al., 2011; SPRC, 2008). Forcing staff to only use a students' legal name/deny them access to school bathrooms will negatively affect the mental health of both parties (the student, for being denied such a basic right as to be called what they want to be called, and the staff for being mandated to break trust with a student). The policy also creates pointless issues for non-transgender students - in my middle school class in Virginia, several students went by nicknames that had nothing to do with their legal names (""Carrie"" went by ""Morgan"", Xiang Zhi went by ""John""). This policy puts an undue burden of cost, time, and money on parents and youth to legally change the child's name in order for them to be identified appropriately on the day-to-day.   Single-stall bathrooms are few and far between, especially in rural counties where all students might attend a single middle or high school; facilities such as stadiums and locker rooms; or campuses that are spread across multiple buildings. Policies that state transgender and nonbinary youth can only access single-stall bathrooms or else be forced to use bathrooms aligned with assigned sex is therefore an access issue.  Mandating staff to out students to their parents puts youth at risk for abuse from unaffirming family members. The harm from this action can be anything from the guardians pulling the student from school counseling, to kicking them out of the home entirely, to physical abuse, suicide, or even murder of the child.  Children thrive when they feel safe in schools - all changes should be rejected. ",129120,9/26/22  9:18am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129120

"Kayla Chonoles, Waynesboro High School ","Re: 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in VA","To Whom It May Concern, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools. I am an English teacher at Waynesboro High School, and I participate in many school activities as a class co-sponsor and as a part of the theater department. I would like to raise serious concerns regarding these model policies.  At WHS, there are approximately 90 transgender and gender-expansive students. These policies would directly negatively impact their daily lives by denying them the ability to safely express themselves and be affirmed for who they are. These students are deserving of protection and support. The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the new model policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a crucial form of suicide prevention.  Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: Transgender youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in part because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by caregivers due to their trans identity. The Trevor Project states that “38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth reported housing instability and homelessness.” By requiring educators such as teachers and guidance counselors to automatically inform parents of their child’s transgender identity if the student comes out at school, the state puts young people in a position where they must either suppress their identities entirely or risk the roof over their heads.  In summary, these new policies would in reality deny students the privacy, dignity, and respect they deserve. Schools have an important role in supporting the mental health and safety of their transgender and nonbinary students. As an educator dedicated to creating learning environments where everyone can thrive, I urge you to substantially revise these model policies to protect trans youth.  Sincerely, Kayla Chonoles Masters of Arts in Teaching, 2019 https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2020/?section=Introduction  https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Trevor-Project-Homelessness-Report.pdf  ",,9/26/22  9:19am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129124
Anonymous ,Protect Trans Kids,"As an adult trans woman I oppose this rule. I spent my teenage years suffering in silence, thinking nobody else could possibly understand, or that there was no way I would ever be accepted at school—and that was before there even were rules about this at the state level. I was unspeakably depressed, and it really only got worse as time went on and I continued developing without any intervention. I grew to hate my body and hate myself, all because I knew I could never reach my ideal. And reaching my ideal was the only option—otherwise I knew I would be rejected and abused by society. The solution to this problem was not learning to accept this misery, learning to play this role I had been assigned without complaint. The solution was realizing that I had control over my own life, that I had a say in who I grew up to be. That is what trans kids need. They don’t need to be silenced and denied and shamed. They need to know that there is a chance for them to be who they want to be. Reject this new rule. The 2021 guidance was the correct policy and should not be negated.",129125,9/26/22  9:19am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129125

As a school professional who is connected with other school divisions around the state, I have heard of no true, verified problems created by this 2021 policy (only the solutions and protections it put in place.) To the degree that there are any real (not imagined or theoretical) issues raised by the 2021 model policy, then the next step would be to proposed very specific adjustments, not a wholesale roll-back. During the 2021 comment period, I reviewed the public comments. Among those who were afraid of supporting trans and non-binary students, all to many literally used phrases such as ""bring back bullying."" In proposing a reversal to the 2021 model policy, I am afraid that Virginia is listening to such fear-based, irrational, and hateful voices.",129126,9/26/22  9:19am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129126
Anonymous ,Strongly Support,"Both of my children at one point thought they might be trans. Their entire friend groups thought so too, and I noticed the contagion aspect of it all, so I just gave them the room to feel out the identity without any pressure to do something about it on my end. I approached it the same as I would have if they shared their interest in a new band or hobby. Low and behold, they both grew out of it. I'm lucky in regards to having close relationships with my children who feel comfortable enough to speak openly about things they are going through, but had they not had that, I can imagine them getting further caught up in going down a road that isn't actually who they are, because that's exactly what the schools are creating. They've both told me of the pressures of being anything other that ""cis"" and ""white."" How it's the worst of the worst and schools have made them feel unworthy of their humanity due to their innate sexual nature/preference and their skin color. So, it's no wonder when one in a friend group says they're trans and the schools are constantly pumping out trans/queer talking points, the whole group starts experimenting with the label, as it's an easy way to escape the stigma of being an ""oppressor."" That's absolutely the environment being created in schools currently.  For what it's worth, up until all of this trans ideology started getting pushed, I had been a staunchly democratic voter. I just can not anymore with where the left is going. Seeing what I've now seen, I know if I was a teen currently, I'd be caught up in it all too. I was a tomboy that grew into a confident woman because no one cared that I was gender non-conforming and preferred playing with the boys. Were I in schools now, I'd be pressured and fast tracked into a trans identity because I guess we're going back to sexist stereotypes.

"Henrico Parent, M.Ed ",Strongly Opposed ,"The policy released for transgender and non-binary students is extremely dangerous and cruel. Children know who they are, and as adults we should trust them to show their true selves. This policy absolutely does not protect children and parents’ rights. This protects bigots who are afraid of people different from them. When we don’t allow students to be their true selves, we risk their safety and mental health.  As a teacher, currently on child rearing leave, I can assure you that students can only learn and thrive in a place where they feel safe, loved, and valued. Teachers must first ensure that Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs are met so that children can learn. Part of this is ensuring a child’s safety.  By forcing families to provide permission and documents to support their children, and forcing children to out themselves in potentially unsafe situations, you are doing the exact opposite of these things. Follow the research, which these policies are wrong on a human and educational level, and state law. Trans and non-binary students are valued and deserving of a space to learn where they can truly be themselves, without interference and permission from an adult.  As a parent, if my children choose to use a different bathroom or pronouns they will be supported and loved. I expect the same from any classroom and school my child enters. This would not be the case, should these policies be in place. ",129129,9/26/22  9:21am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129129

"Albert Pollard, ",Reject or heavily amend the proposal. Respect trans kids.,"As the father of a transgender child and also a former legislator, I ask that you reject these changes. It is a matter of opinion and not of fact that ""The 2021 Model Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools.""  While respectful, I was pretty ignorant of trans issues before my son came out. To that end, I think the most helpful thing to realize when reviewing these new guidelines is that a young adult is not ""changing their gender"", rather those around them have a new realization of their gender.  That is, for a true trans child their gender has been the same all along, it is merely the adults perception that has changed.  I would also like to point out that this model policy doesn't separate schools and parents, it injects government into the life of parents and a child.  Asking teachers to police nicknames is just silly and waste of time... Christopher, a male, now goes by Chris and has long hair. Maybe the child is transitioning. Government to the rescue! Call the parents! Maybe next we should have teachers contact the parents if their kids are dating another child because it might be a violation of the parental rights that their child dates someone... In fact the proper teacher response to a gay or trans child is: Are, are they ""coming out""?!? Who cares! Do they have poor grades and seems depressed... that is when you care and reach out to a school counselor.  There are many tricky issues around this topic but they involve permanent life decisions such as surgery. The school system won't be involved in these in any regard and the parent should have every traditional right over an unemancipated minor in these cases. Everything else is - names, dress, etc is transitory and not the government's business.  Albert Pollard Irvington VA 22480  ",129131,9/26/22  9:21am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129131

It is incredibly harmful to not respect individuals enough to call them by their name and pronouns. Every death of a student if these policies go into place are because of Youngkin. If this was about respect of beliefs, then these policies would not exist.

Erica Sims ,Oppose this Guidance,"As a parent of a young child attending Virginia public schools, I oppose this guidance. It is clear in reading the comments in support of this guidance that this ""parents rights"" or ""parents choice"" language is a guise. The guidance seems to me to seek to shame and delegitimize transgender and other nonbinary identities. Commenters in support of this guidance make claims around the physical and sexual safety of children - saying that to keep children safe from predatory behavior, this guidance must be approved. Commenters state that transgender or nonbinary identities are not scientifically or emotionally valid, that they don't exist and should not be recognized by society. This is what is at the heart of this bill, not parent involvement. No one on either side of this debate wants parents to be eliminated from important decisions and discussions related to their children. To suggest otherwise is a perfect example of gaslighting. Our current school system and guidance allows me, as a parent, to be as fully involved as I need and want to be in important decisions concerning my child.

Anonymous ,"This is wrong, oppose.","There are several parts of this proposal that I'd like to go over. For one, forcefully outing kids to their parents is setting up some of them to be abused and murdered by relatives that don't understand or choose not to. Their suffering would be on you. Furthermore, not every kid who thinks they might be trans actually is, they could be just seeing how different styles or pronouns fit them in the safety of school. And by forcefully outing them, you might take away that experimentation, putting even cis kids in danger. Also, where is the line drawn? If a young cis girl isn't performing femininity to your standards, does she get ""outed"" as trans? Is she no longer allowed to use the bathroom that she feels most comfortable using? Is she kicked off of her sports teams? It doesn't make any sense, and is frankly just a disgusting way of controlling kids. As for the restriction of using a preferred name, that also makes absolutely no sense. I remember so many kids asking to be called nicknames or something other than their legal names, and more often than not that made it easier on the teachers. Many kids asked to be called something else if someone shared their first name in the class. This proposal would completely take that possibility from them, leading to more issues. Then there's the fact that some people never even really go by their legal names. I knew someone who, from being a small child, they had a nickname and pretty much everyone called them by it. And none of that is even taking into account the fact that being called your deadname on a daily basis, hurts. It frankly should be avoided at all cost, or the person will just come to associate that name with terrible things. That's what happened with my deadname. My mom refuses to use my name, and I feel genuine hate towards that name instead of just thinking that it wasn't for me, like I used to. Protect trans kids, protect cis kids, but those protections DO NOT have to come at the cost of the other.

"Katharine Smorodin, School Counselor ",Strongly Oppose,"56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020). Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for transgender males and 149% for transgender females (Murchison et al., 2019). 28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020).

Parent. Teacher. Coach. ,Support this revised policy ,"I fully support the proposed 2022 Guidelines.  The 2021 Guidance put schools in the position of severing the parent-child relationship, of deciding what is best for a child and of unduly influencing a minor child.  While supportive schools are essential, and the rights of every student are equally important, parents know, love and care for their children far more than schools, which are transient in a child's life.  The previous 2021 guidance went far beyond State and Federal Law in wresting decision-making and authority away from parents and handing it over to schools and non-guardians.   This new guidance appropriately revokes the deceit authorized by the 2021 guidance, which in practice directed schools to conceal its interactions with a minor child, whether over counseling or use of pronouns, facilities etc. This deceitful aspect of the 2021 guidance was one of its most problematic and dangerous features. The previous guidance put girls and women in harm's way by allowing males into all their safe spaces.  While the intent of the 2021 guidance is to allow transgender students to chose facilities, the practice in the way it is worded disallows questioning of any male entering a female space.  Further, the population of girls and women who have been victims of sexual assault is far greater than the population of transgender students, and it is wrong and dangerous for these women to have to fear males entering private spaces with them. There are reasonable and fair ways to protect transgender students without taking away the right to privacy and safety of every female in the system. Further, the former guidance unlawfully compelled speech as to pronoun usage, again going far beyond both State and federal law.  Every child deserves equal respect, but the law does not grant them the right to compel the speech of others. Every school will have to work out ways to respect and support transgender children, including for children who may face danger at home. It goes without question that support, compassion and respect are essential to caring for transgender children in schools. The answer, however, is not a blanket order affecting all families by unlawfully removing parental authority and involvement from a child's life, as was the effect of the previous guidance.  Schools and counselors should be partners with children and parents, not usurpers of parental roles. This policy is a great step forward in removing the excesses of the 2021 Guidance. I borrowed these words from another supporter because they said so eloquently what I too wish to say and why I support these revisions. Please support parental rights and what’s good and just for kids. ",129182,9/26/22  9:34am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129182
Anonymous ,I OPPOSE THE PROPOSED 2022 MODEL,"I OPPOSE the proposed 2022 Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools. This document will only hurt transgender students and will undo all the progress we have made to protect them from bullying and harrassment. 1. This proposal requires teachers and staff to forcibly “out” students to their parents. This is extremely dangerous, as many parents are not accepting, thus creating a hostile home environment. This will also prevent transgender students from speaking to an adult whom they trust at school. Teachers are not only there to teach; they are there to provide support and guidance when a student needs it the most.2. Teachers and staff are prohibited from using a trans student’s name and pronouns unless given permission from their parents. Studies have proven time and time again that using a trans person’s correct name and pronouns significantly improves their mental health and can help prevent suicide. By forcing staff to use a student’s deadname and incorrect pronouns, you are creating an extremely stressful environment for them. In addition, cis children have been allowed to use nicknames that are different from their legal names forever; how is a trans child with a different name from their records any different? 3. This model requires transgender students to play on sport’s teams that align with their assigned sex at birth. This is also dangerous for not only transgender students but every student. How is this going to be enforced? I fear that genital inspections will become the norm. There has also been a news story where a parent wanted to check if a girl who beat their child in a sport’s competition was transgender. This is a complete invasion of privacy. Sports in schools are also about fostering a sense of teamwork and community. You are taking this away from transgender children.Overall, this model will only HARM transgender and non-binary students. It does absolutely nothing to protect them in a place they are required to attend every day. It also goes completely against all the guidance from medical professionals and statistics that show how trans children’s mental health significantly improves when we respect them.

John ,Oppose changes due to certainty of student harm,"I am a lifelong resident of Virginia, and I oppose the proposed changes to this guidance document. Transgender children are at a great risk. The life they must lead is inherently difficult, and can be made much worse by humiliations and hostility from their community and the adults responsible for their care and education. This can unfortunately lead to severe mental health struggles and even suicide. It is very important here to take the position supported overwhelmingly by science: affirming the gender identity of trans people dramatically reduces their suffering, and their risk of suicide. Respectfully, giving transgender people this basic degree of dignity is far more important than the ""rights of parents"" to be bigoted and reject someone's very self, religiously motivated or otherwise. The former is life-saving. Respecting a transgender person's identity is not an ideological position or an opinion; it's a matter of fundamental humanity and respect, if you care at all about the well-being of that person (as demonstrated by scientific consensus). Therefore, to systematically insist that a transgender person is not who they are (as these proposed guidelines would allow school staff and students to do uninhibited, through condoning the use of incorrect pronouns and names, or by requiring trans students to share intimate spaces with members of the wrong gender), in complete disregard for the negative consequences this will have on that person, is an act of inhuman malice.

Kirby M ,Do not support this cruel measure,"Being trans is not a fad. People who experience difficulty with their assigned gender at birth face a challenging road of self-discovery even when they do not have to contend with an entire political party doing everything in its power to vilify their support network and their choices. Carrying out this policy is a blatant political ploy that will result in harm to children, and those who support this policy have received ample warning about what it will do. To be clear, Republicans did not suddenly become concerned about trans children overnight. They already hated trans people and they found a way to legitimize and disguise their straightforward bigotry. If you implement this policy, any harm that comes to trans children is blood on your hands. If you really care about helping children, you should think long and hard about why you think it's OK to side with the group that are perfectly fine seeing trans children suffer and won't even concede that whatever their concerns about cis children, some kids really are trans and need our help.

Wren ,Gov. Younkin is putting youth in danger,"As a queer, nonbinary person myself, gov. younkin's actions are putting our community in danger. Apart from the harmful rhetoric about trans people in general (who are overwhelmingly more likely to be the victim of a crime than the perpetrator of it) both forcing people in or out of the closet is going to have costs. Being forced in the closet can feel oppressive, as you are forced to act a part for everyone with no reprieve to live authentically (an experience glenn will never have to understand) on the other hand, being outed before you are ready can set people (youth especially) up to face physical and emotional violence at the hands of family and peers. LGBT people, especially trans people, already have much higher rates of eating disorders, mental illness, self harm, and suicide then the general public. More so in communities that make it clear that they are not safe and welcome. youngkin is fine letting youth suffer to feed a lie passed on by people with power and prejudice.  Someone's personal gender or queer identity is no business of the state, apart from changing one's name on official documents. This should go doubly for youth, who's gender transition consists of nothing more than a new name and wardrobe - something many youth queer or otherwise will experience. If Abigail wants to go by Abby and dress goth that is seen as youthful exploration of identity, however if Abigail wants to go by Elliott and dress more masculine they are ""indoctrinated"" or are somehow in danger or putting their community in danger. Exploring your identity is essential to growing up, and queer youth deserve to do so safely without fearing that adults who are supposed to protect them will put them further in danger.  The choice to not capitalize gov. youngkin's name is purposeful - bigotry does not earn the respect of capitalization.  To any queer youth (or young at heart) that may be reading this looking for any kind of support - it does get better. Our community will welcome you with open arms by any name or label that you choose. Seek community, pass on as much love as possible, and build other's up in a world that constantly wants to tear us down. Queer existence is radical, and no person should have to align their identity to fit within the confines of the wishes of the state. There is no one mold for being human, there are centuries of queer people standing with you, and millions waiting to welcome you into our community today.  ",129220,9/26/22  9:47am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129220

Anonymous ,Support ,"It is unfortunate that public schools have been at the forefront of the identity politics game, and it is way past time to protect the children from this tug 'o war. There is a pandemic of gender dysphoria and our most vulnerable population has borne the brunt. Celebration and affirmation of such a disorder may not be the best course of action, but even if it were, the schools are not in place to decide or pass judgement in either direction. If I remember correctly, schools are a place of learning. While some bias is unavoidable because teachers and children are human beings, the focus of school should be fundamentally education, not social engineering. Teachers and counselors are not co-parenting, nor do they have the right to attempt to do so. On the other hand, for teachers and counselors who do not fall in line with the current progressive march, compelled speech like self-generated pronouns is inappropriate and violates the 1st Amendment.  Personally, I would like to see the government step out of education entirely, but if it needs to be a necessary evil (which I doubt), then its role should be narrowly defined to teach the fundamentals, such as reading and arithmetic, writing and history, science and trades, music and life skills (such as gardening, cooking, and budgeting).  I fully support this attempt to limit the role of our schools in the battle of gender politics.   ",129234,9/26/22  9:51am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129234

counselor ,strongly oppose,"The Virginia School Counselor Association (VSCA) opposes the Virginia Department of Education’s 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools as they are currently proposed. The 2022 model policies create barriers to privacy, dignity, and respect for Virginia’s students and seek to undermine previous legislation (i.e., § 22.1-23.3. Treatment of transgender students; policies) that works to create safe and supportive environments for our most vulnerable youth.  VSCA recognizes that: 56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020). Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for transgender males and 149% for transgender females (Murchison et al., 2019). 28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020). Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked out or abused (Thoma, 2021). Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022). Virginia school counselors work to remove barriers and support the social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. VSCA Ends Policies state that “Virginia School Counselors are committed to working with and advocating for marginalized groups, promote the mental health and wellness of all students, adhere to the ASCA Ethical Standards for School Counselors, and actively work to dismantle destructive systemic inequities.” Additionally, Virginia school counselors follow the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Position Statement on The School Counselor and Transgender and Nonbinary Youth (Adopted 2016, revised 2022) that states:  School counselors work to safeguard the well-being of transgender and nonbinary youth. School counselors recognize all students have the right to be treated equally and fairly, with dignity and respect as unique individuals, free from discrimination, harassment and bullying based on their gender identity and gender expression. Finally, Virginia school counselors seek to create environments that are not only inclusive and equitable for all students, including our transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students, but that celebrate the full scope of their identities, allowing them to thrive and reach their fullest potential. Furthermore, Virginia school counselors commit to dismantling any and all forms of inequity in Virginia’s public education system and fully support LGBTQ+ students. Every Virginia student, regardless of their gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation, has a right to learn free from discrimination and harassment. Against this background, it is VSCA’s stance that the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools are empirically unfounded and are not in accordance with evidence-based best practices concerning the treatment of transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students.",,9/26/22  9:57am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129257
Donivan  Potter ,I Opposed this harmful new policy ,"I'm a little bit different than the average transgender person. I happen to have an unknown muscle condition. The muscle condition gets worse with stress and other factors. treating my gender dysphoria medically with hormones has been the only thing to help lower my cpks, that's the muscle tissue enzymes breaking down. nothing else ever worked to lower my cpks to normal. When you refer to somebody that is transgender and suffering gender dysphoria like myself a pronoun that's not appropriate, one that goes against my identity.  it adds stress which causes my muscles to tense and that causes my muscle tissue to break down more.  that causes toxins to build up into me it's where my organs can fail. It's a shame that you think your beliefs are more important than my life and health.  I transitioned to save my life, Republicans with your hate and your ignorance you're negating all my efforts to save my life. All I know is ignorance and hate does not belong in schools. and that's what this new policy is it's nothing but ignorance and hate. I have a neighbor that listens to Youngkin and other people that spread rhetoric and lies about transgender people. My neighbor, he says that people like LGBT need to be took out and murdered. The fact this policy wants teachers to out LGBTQ students to people like my neighbor is wrong and dangerous. Not all parents are supportive and some are just like my neighbor. I didn't come out to my own parents my mom never knew. my dad finally knew late in life. I was scared about losing them, I can't imagine the stress that students will feel knowing that you're going to try to out them.  that stress would have prevented me from having a good education at all. the fact that I had to hide my identity prevented me from having a good education. I never learned nothing about myself in school, not in health class or any other class for that matter. I felt alone isolated and scared the whole time. That's what you're doing again, repeating history and you're doing wrong by people you're causing more harm than any good with this rotten policy.",129258,9/26/22  9:57am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129258

Caitlyn White ,Strongly oppose,"These proposed policies are discriminatory and cruel and will be the cause of so much harm if passed. Kids go to school to learn, not to be disrespected and told who they are is wrong and shameful. What pronouns or names kids use has nothing to with learning and education and is absolutely not your place to regulate. Banning children from sports  and telling them what bathrooms they are allowed to use is ridiculous. Is banning children from school activities and telling them they can’t participate because of who they are, is that what you want your legacy to be?? And anyones bathroom use is absolutely none of your business. As for forcing schools and teachers to out Lgbtq students and tell their parents- absolutely ignorant and an act of violence. You will be putting so many children in danger and their blood will be on your hands. There are countless parents and family that are unsafe and unsupportive and you are putting children at the risk of homelessness, abuse, conversion therapy, and death. 50% of all teens get a negative reaction when coming out to their parents and 1 in 4 teens are forced to leave their homes after coming out. And Roughly 34% of LGBT youth report suffering physical violence from their parents as a result of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. You will be actively putting kids in harms way. And that’s not even taking into account the effects on their mental health. Being told they can’t do this or that and their identity is shameful and has to be reported to possible unsupportive parents- this will add even more to the mental health crisis in lgbtq youths. More than half of transgender and nonbinary youth have seriously considered suicide and Lgbtq youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide than their peers. Discriminating against them and regulating every part of them and putting them In harms way will only make it worse. Is that the legacy you want? To be the ones who increased youths suicide rates and homelessness?? We should be encouraging children and helping their lights to grow and be confident in themselves, not completely stifling that light. Maybe worry more about school shootings and bullying and the youth in poverty that can’t afford food or school supplies, instead of what’s in their pants and what name they prefer. Do something to make things better for kids, not worse. ",129264,9/26/22  9:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129264

It would be irresponsible and put the lives of children at risk should this policy be implemented.   As an aside, this policy also affects cis children as well as trans children. As the policy reads, any child with a nickname ""that is not commonly associated with their name"" (which leaves a lot of wiggle room with interpretation. How can I know what is and isn't an associated nickname?) who wants to use said nickname in the class, I would be required to call their parents and ask if that is okay.

Melissa ,PROTECT TRANS & NON-BINARY YOUTH!!!,"I implore the Board of Education to reject these policies as they are fueled by hatred and transphobia, and are both disgusting and disgraceful.! We must protect transgender and non-binary youth! Trans and non-binary children deserve the same safety and autonomy afforded to their cis peers. Trans youth face extremely high rates of suicide attempts because they already feel excluded, different, and unsafe in their own bodies, in their own homes. This policy will have a direct effect to make that WORSE for trans children in Virginia schools, make no doubt that if enacted this will be responsible for a higher rate of suicide among queer kids. The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the new model policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a crucial form of suicide prevention. Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: Transgender youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in part because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by caregivers due to their trans identity. The Trevor Project states that “38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth reported housing instability and homelessness.” By requiring educators such as teachers and guidance counselors to automatically inform parents of their child’s transgender identity if the student comes out at school, the state puts young people in a position where they must either suppress their identities entirely or risk the roof over their heads. Mandating staff to out students to their parents puts youth at risk for abuse from unaffirming family members. The harm from this action can be anything from the guardians pulling the student from school counseling, to kicking them out of the home entirely, to physical abuse, suicide, or even murder of the child.",129285,9/26/22  10:01am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129285

Parent of two high schoolers ,"New policy is cruel, unsupportive, and WRONG","According to Pew research, 5% of young adults in the US identify as trans or non-binary. Studies show that 40% of trans youth have attempted suicide, and 82% have contemplated it. Trans and non-binary kids need all the support they can get, both at home and at school.  If they are not getting support at home, the LEAST they should have is support at school.  An environment where kids are rejected for who they are at home AND at school is where you get 40% suicide rates.  Is that really what we want for 5% of our youth?? For those who wouldn't support their child who came out as trans, consider that situation carefully.  It can be a life or death decision.  But I digress... For those who don't have a trans kid, or don't know a trans kid, or don't know anyone who has a trans kid, you probably do.  You just don't know it yet.  Remember, 5%.  5%.  This 5% of our youth need ALL the love and support the community can give them, and this new Younkin policy rips that support away in the guise of ""parent's rights"" and ""free speech for teachers"".  That's laughable.  This is an anti-trans policy that is cruel, unsupportive, and just plain WRONG.

I am writing today to express my strong opposition to the Governors proposed changes that would directly impact the lives of trans students in the Commonwealth of Virginia.Transgender students deserve to feel safe and accepted just like every other person. and trans youth are already at a higher risk of depression, suicide, and violence. This decision is leading to make the lives harder of kids and teens already struggling with their gender identity and sexual orientation. Some statistics for you to consider - 40% of all homeless youth in the United States identify as LGBTQ+ (Morton, M.H., Dworsky, A., Matjasko, J.L., Curry, S.R., Schlueter, D., Chávez, R. & Farrell, A.F. (in press). Prevalence and correlates of youth homelessness in the United States. Journal of Adolescent Health.), three-quarters of students who identify as transgender or non-binary have felt unsafe at school because of the way they expressed their gender (75.1%), and of those students who identified as “another gender” or “genderqueer,” two-thirds felt unsafe at school (‘another gender” 61.2% and “genderqueer” 61.6% ). Finally, trans people are over 4 times more likely than cisgender people to be victims of violent crime. This guidance also runs the very real risk of forcing teachers to out students against their will, which could lead to the potential of violence and abuse against the child. I want to make this very clear, just because it is 2022 and the LGBTQ+ rights movement has made strides over the last decade or so does not mean we are completely safe. Even now kids are thrown out of their homes, beaten and abused just for being who they truly are. People who are LGBTQ+ deserve the right to come out to people when they are ready and only when they are ready, as I did at the age of 21.  Children deserve to feel safe at school and at home, and I hope the administration will change its stance and stop this dangerous guidance from going into effect.",,9/26/22  10:02am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129301
Christopher J. Campa ,"Being Transgender is real, not an illness. Oppose!","I oppose these changes to school policies that prevent Transgender students from using facilities that correspond with their gender identity.  Being Transgender is real, not an illness.  I know many transgender people and they are exactly like every cisgender person I’ve known.  Like Dwyane Wade said, it’s not the transgender kids that have a problem.  It’s the adults mentality that’s the problem. These Transgender students know who they are better than most.  Preventing them from using the bathroom and locker rooms at school will not erase them.

Kelsey Wright ,Strongly Oppose,"I strongly oppose the guidelines proposed by the Board of Education. I believe they are dangerous, harmful and discriminatory. School should be a safe, accepting and supportive environment for all students, especially LGBTQ+ students. Students should not be deadnamed or forced into the wrong bathrooms. Many students are not able to safely come out to their families, let alone be accepted. They should be able to be out at school and live their truth without fear that they will be outed to their families. Outing students will inevitably lead to some students being abused at home, and some harming themselves. This harm is preventable and the blood will be on the hands of Governor Youngkin's Board of Education. These guidelines will worsen bullying and harassment of transgender and other LGBTQ+ students.  As stated by Dr. Moira Szilagyi, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, ""The emotional and psychological trauma of rejection, whether by family, friends, society, or lawmakers, can leave scars that never heal.?When we fail to accept people for who they are, we pass painful judgements on them and create so much unnecessary emotional and psychological pain.""

I cannot imagine a world in which any person, child or adult, telling me they identify as LGBTQ+ would cause me to then treat them as LESS of a human. Our schools should be the safest place for our students. No teacher or staff member should be forced by bigoted political legislation to put these children in danger either by “outing” them to someone who does not support who they are or by making them feel they must hide who they truly are in order to not be “outed”.  I cannot believe that we have come so far as a society, only to be actually discussing taking such a major step back.We have to do better.  We have to provide these students with safe placed to learn.  We have to provide them support and encouragement to be who they are.  And above all, we MUST treat them with respect and dignity.  ",129324,9/26/22  10:07am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129324

H Alston ,Strongly oppose this.,"It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth that ALL students have the opportunity to receive a high-quality education in Virginia (see: Code of Virginia, § 22.1-23.3). To quote, ""The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students. The Department also fully acknowledges the rights of parents to exercise their fundamental rights granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children. The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents to determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is essential to improving outcomes for all children in Virginia. The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological belief. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or religious beliefs."" This guidance document completely contravenes the current legal protection offered to all children by the Virginia Department of Education.

Those who seek to operate in secrecy do so to enable evil and lack the moral compass to be around children.

Chris Catanzaro ,Bring Back 2021 Model Policies,"The 2021 model policies for transgenered students were carefully crafted with a lot of input and collaboration from every type of stakeholder. The categories of stakeholders involved is clearly stated in the document, and it includes parents. However, the 2022 model clearly states that it includes the VALUES of parents. This is disturbing as a ""wolf disguised in sheeps clothing"". The basic issue here is NOT about empowering parents. People who are uninformed about transgenedered individuals are fearful and naturally want to protect their own children. And we all know that many children do not value peers who are different. This issue in the 2022 model policies was clearly written with a reactionary lens. It's not ok to discriminate against trans kids due to our personal values. This issue is about protections sadly necessary for transgenedered students. ""The Virginia Department of Education continuse to be ommitted to working with school divisions to ensure a positive, safe, and nurturing learning environment for all students.""

Repealing previous protections because parents have complained about their right to control their child's education and environment is not only an absurd overreaction to the concerns of a minority on an issue that does not affect their child's safety, it is an overreach of the BoE in that it is listening only to a privileged few who dedicate their lives to hurting others and allowing transphobes to control the school system. No other group this small has ever been granted this much power to control the policies that affect every student in Virginia. If parental rights are so important, what about the right of trans children's parents to not have to treat their children's depression and inability to be themselves?

Furthermore, LGBTQ plus children are subject to abuse and familial rejection if their parents refuse to acknowledge their gender identity, which is traumatizing. Governor Youngkin is exploiting children to further his political goals, as children as young as three experience gender dysphoria.

If you try to ""persuade"" your trans kids into being cis, you end up with a dead kid.What a child watches or knows about, doesn't suddenly change turn them into that thing, but hiding information from them is a sure sign you are at the very least manipulating your child and what they are allowed to think is ""okay"". If your child is begging teachers not to tell you that they're trans, maybe you should reflect on why your child is so scared of you. Children should be able to trust that their parents will help them, and be there for them, not actively abuse them every time them intentionally use the wrong name or tell them they don't know anything.Does no one remember what it was like being a child? Didn't you wish you could just cuddle with your momma and not worry about anything? Why are you so afraid of letting children feel safe within themselves?",129424,9/26/22  10:20am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129424
Anonymous ,Children have rights too. Opposed!!!,"Under the bill of rights, every citizen has the right to free speech under the first amendment. Children are people and citizens, they have the right to express themselves how they feel and the law should not impede on that. If a child identifies themselves a different way than their birth sex, it is their right. The law should not be involved unless it is to protect that right, otherwise it is infringing upon said rights. The US is a beautiful country for how we have laws to protect self expression, let's not force children into a world where they cannot be themselves nor be forced to bow to a temporary state of the ever shifting societal norm.   Children have the right to free speech too.

"Liz Todd, Virginia Educator ",Teacher Strongly Opposes Policy,"My concerns as an educator starts with my students. I am not a teacher for parents, I am a teacher for students. I want my students to be comfortable and feel safe in the classroom. I have already established trust with my trans students, and they know that their information is safe with me. If required to ask parents prior to using a name or set of pronouns, my students would not be able to be themselves in the class, and many would be afraid of repercussions should their parents find out. It would be irresponsible and put the lives of children at risk should this policy be implemented.   As an aside, this policy also affects cis children as well as trans children. As the policy reads, any child with a nickname ""that is not commonly associated with their name"" (which leaves a lot of wiggle room with interpretation. How can I know what is and isn't an associated nickname?) who wants to use said nickname in the class, I would be required to call their parents and ask if that is okay.

Anonymous ,Parent Strongly Opposes,"As a gay person who grew up long ago in Virginia public schools, supporting ALL students is imperative. If a child is made to feel inferior to their peers, especially by the adults tasked with teaching and caring for them, that child will most likely develop a host of mental and emotional problems. Being transgender is well established science, despite what some news organizations might say. It is also well established and documented that allowing free expression of however a child might be wishing to present themselves is healthy and does no harm to their development. Even the medical community agrees that even minimum support during puberty for a transgender child is completely reversible and does no harm to the child, and in fact helps them grow in a more positive way.  As a parent, I am appalled that school boards and local governments around the country are trying to pass rules and laws that directly harm children. The parents that are behind these actions are not doing so out of any factual issues, but out of fear mongering and bigotry. That has absolutely no place in our education system. This is no different than the uproar about segregation back in the 1960s, and the white people you see in the photos from that time screaming and throwing hatred at the black children just trying to attend schools could very well have been taken today with transgender children.  They are just as ugly now as they were then.",129442,9/26/22  10:22am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129442

Survivor of transphobia ,"Transphobia kills, transphobia maims","Less than a decade ago, I was a teenager living in rural northern Virginia. I knew fellow children who were regularly beaten for being LGBT+ while school staff looked the other way. I watched as many LGBT+ teens who didn't have the shield of being popular prior to coming out were discussed casually with slurs around lunch tables in hallways. I had to sit through a conversation with a well respected teacher and writer for the local paper as he described his disgust towards LGBT+ people and how they shouldn't be allowed in the military and don't ask don't tell shouldn't have ended.    I know children who didn't survive. I know people still in the area who cannot safely come out as transgender, and are planning on dying without telling anyone still in my hometown, because they fear severe violence. I myself, left my hometown as soon as I was physically able to, and promptly socially transitioned (with medical transition following shortly afterwards once I could afford it). I do not plan on returning to live there, because I fear severe violence from the community.    This policy encourages for a culture of violent anti-LGBT+ rhetoric to thrive within schools, and by extension the counties and towns these schools serve. It is a joke that it was ever considered as a state policy. Those who back it are fully knowledgeable that this policy is dangerous for students, but will appease the Christo-fascist voters who they want to gain support from.    Children who wish to by a different name, use different pronouns, dress differently, and use restrooms pose no threat to other students. Affirming them does them no harm. Affirming students does not harm the quality of education being received by their peers.  Children deserve to be safe at school, many do not have safe homes to return to at night.

Our kids don't want it and the overwhelming majority of parents don't want it. The small minority of cowardly and fearful parents pushing for policies like this don't get to make the rules for everyone else.  Hatred and discrimination are manifestations of fear. What are you afraid of governor? Are you afraid students will learn to be respectful of people that don't look like them, don't pray like them, and don't fit YOUR preconceived notions? Is respect, and tolerance, and inclusivity a threat to you and your supporters? Are you intent on churning out generations of bigots that enter the real world and find that they have been gaslighted by the adults making the rules? It does not hurt grown ups one damn bit to call a student by a preferred name. In fact, hundred of thousands of kids in Virginia schools go by a nickname different than their full legal name. No one asks parents for permission to call a kid Cathy instead of Catherine. And no grown up is ""harmed"" for not being a jerk.  Your rules are juvenile, harmful, and probably illegal.

Vic N ,Law and balancing all rights and sides,"Reading over the whole proposal: it puts an end to discrimination/harassment of any/all students. That means trans or not. Contrary to what is purveyed out in the media, teens who have detransitioned indicated they got a lot of support being trans.  it requires parents, who are constitutionally responsible for their offspring in every way, to consent to counseling services. Considering schools are not able to dispense medications without parental consent, this is consistent. It also requires them to consent to name/pronoun changes so they are again in charge of their offspring, having the right to raise them with the values they see fit, and not some agenda pushing public employee. This allows for freedom of speech for teachers to not agree - and something that any human has to get used to as not everyone is going to agree with your choices.  mandating safe spaces for each sex is provided for, thereby eliminating half of the student population that is upset enough to not go to the bathroom during school due to fear of the opposite sex coming in, also due to the rapes/sodomies that occurred, whereby school officials covered up the violence and allowed it to happen again.

"Laura O'Reilly, Parent and Voter ","Strongly oppose this harmful, unnecessary, unlawful proposed policy","I strongly oppose the Youngkin administration's proposed changes to the Model Policy. The proposed policies are hateful and harmful to LGBTQIA+ students, and all community members. There is no reason why queer students should not be able to live openly in their school community if they choose to do so. Mental health and medical providers, as well as educators, already know that anti-trans and homophobic policies and laws directly cause harm to these children. It is outrageous that this administration would target a vulnerable population for political gains. The policy is unnecessary to protect parents' rights because parents already have rights in their children's educations. It is a lie when they say that parents are cut out of the public school system. If parents want to be involved they can start by talking to their own kids and their kids' teachers. They can view all educational materials on line or in person at schools. They can review policies on line. They can attend PTA meetings, parent teacher conferences, and school board meetings. In the many years my children have attended public schools, when I have reached out to teachers or administrators, the responses have been open and transparent (even if I did not necessarily like the outcome). The policy literally asks school boards to violate the law by enforcing unconstitutional discrimination against transgender students. For example, the 4th Circuit's decision in the Grimm case explicitly held that schools must allow students to use the restroom of their identified gender, and yet this policy states the opposite. Conservatives claim to be for law and order, but this policy explicitly violates the law. This policy is using vulnerable students as political pawns before an extremely important election. Youngkin's attempt during the 2021 election to paint himself as the nice guy Republican has been completed debunked by his recent actions. This policy is not for the betterment of Virginia's schools or to support Virginia's students or parents. It is political pandering. The Model Policies should be rejected.",129496,9/26/22  10:31am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129496
Caroline Steinberg ,Opposition to Department of Education Guidance on Treatment of Transgender Children,"I strongly oppose the VA Department of Education's Guidance on the treatment of transgender youth. In defiance of state law, this policy does not follow evidence-based practices and puts our children at risk. Trans youth are nearly four times as likely to have attempted suicide as the population of secondary school students as a whole (see chart below with recent data for Fairfax County). It is only a wanton disregard for the lives of these children that policies can be promulgated that isolate these children even more than they already are.  It has been shown that even one supportive teacher or adult can make a difference in the life of a child. The teacher has a duty to the child not the parent. A sane bathroom policy would be to allow children to use the bathroom that conforms to their gender identity and then have a separate bathroom for anyone who is uncomfortable with that. Sports should be left to sports organizations. Certainly nothing below the high school level should even be an issue. It simply is not that important when weighed against the welfare of a VERY small group of children. Schools are government institutions, and school employees should not be able to impose their religious beliefs on their students or even articulate them as part of their role as a government employee. Separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our republic. If a teacher finds a particular student's identify offends their religion, then accommodations for that teacher should be made by transferring the teacher to another school or otherwise limiting their interaction with these children. The child should not be exposed to any harmful or disrespectful interactions. Name calling is bullying. Using a ""dead' name is name-calling. You may score political points for these heartless policies, but the blood of these children will be on your hands.              CommentID: 129497",129497,9/26/22  10:31am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129497

Meanwhile, the tiny percentage of MAGA Republican parents who enthusiastically support this cruelty are literally burning books and complaining about CRT--a racist dog whistle, if there ever was one. What a bloody waste of our time. This is an attempt to force our Public Schools into serving a tiny minority's narrow view of the world, a view formed by a single religion, which our Constitution clearly states has no place in government--and by extension our public schools. All religions are welcome in our country because our founders saw the consequences of forcing one religion on others.

Diane Deffenbaugh ,Strongly oppose,"First of all, discrimination against transgender individuals is illegal discrimination on the basis of sex. Secondly, restricting the rights of transgender students is morally repugnant. It will do harm to these students who the schools should be helping protect and nurture so that they may grow into their best selves. Their gender/name/pronoun choices are not hurting anyone else. They should be supported and loved. Not all parents support their children's choices, and the consequences can be catastrophic. Why would we want to create a policy that may cause children to be kicked out of their homes or even worse? This Pollyanna idea that everyone has perfect parents who will love them no matter what is ridiculous and unrealistic. If children are not out to their parents, it just may be for a very good reason. Not all homes are safe havens. But our schools should be for ALL students. The idea that teachers can ignore pronoun preferences etc based on their own beliefs is unbelievable and certainly sides with right-wing religious extremists. If a teacher doesn't believe a woman should have a career, can they then choose to not respect the girls in their class and only teach them cooking and cleaning? Should the biology teacher get to choose to teach creationism because that's what their church tells them? I don't care what a teacher's ""beliefs"" are. Respect every child in the class. Period. Protect every child in the class. Period. I believe this policy singles out one small segment of the population and makes it OK to discriminate against them based on a phony problem. There is no evidence that trans students are causing any kinds of problems in schools. And hiding our students from real world complexities, which include gender, is not educating them. It's indoctrinating them to one ideology. I keep hearing about ""parents rights."" Children should have rights, too.

The schools must protect children by respecting the wishes of students in respect to who they don’t feel are the safe adults in their lives.

I often hear that God doesn’t make mistakes. He didn’t make a mistake with me. He made my insides not quite match my outside. To interfere with that is to go against God.  But it necessary for schools and the government to protect children who are like me. We need to be protected from family and friends who would injure us for God’s choice to make us non-binary or transgender. We are very capable of understanding who is a danger to us for being non-binary or transgender. Schools most trust our instincts about the evil people around us. We don’t all have loving and supportive parents. Some of us have parents to squash our spirits and steal our childhoods.  Call kids what they want to be called.

Anonymous ,Strongly OPPOSE ,"OPPOSE- THROW IT OUT. This is literally laughable- this policy actively works against every current mental health and medical guideline (supported by actual research) about how to build policy related to trans kids/the treatment of trans kids. Though I guess that's apparent when the policy defines sex and not gender or even transgender, just ""a transgender student,"" and actively misgenders a transgender person in the additional laws section- making the bias of the policy writer pretty clear. It's interesting how much this policy talks about protecting ""parent's rights,"" as if they would somehow be undermined by a more reasonable policy that would actually protect transgender children- I cannot fathom how a basic acknowledgment that transgender people exist at all and can be treated with the absolute most basic, ground floor level of human decency and passing respect- even if you don't like them- would somehow take away parents role as the primary people raising their child. Should we also stop teaching kids to ask before trying to grab something out of another person's hand, to not hit each other, or other basic social skills?? After all- that might not be how it's done in their house!  Under the ""Maintenance of a safe and supportive learning environment free from discrimination and harassment for all students"" section, this policy seeks to state: The [School Division] prohibits all discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on actual national origin, race, religion, sex, disability, political beliefs, or any other characteristic protected by law. Honestly incredible, to specifically include political beliefs (not protected by law!) and NOT expand that sex also includes gender identity and sexuality (protected by law!) Also, for a policy that mentions bullying so many times, the plan to prevent harassment and bullying could not be more vague Overall- this is possibly the worst policy I have seen, and I would never allow any child of mine to be in any school that applied it, and if it is not scrapped or completely redone, I feel honestly heartbroken for any kids in a school that does apply it. ",129527,9/26/22  10:36am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129527

Anonymous ,Oppose: this is hateful discrimination against basic human expression ,"Despite any concern for children on may bring up in support of this policy, it’s been clear for years that this opens up hatred, bullying, and discrimination against any child who may not fit with what society says is Heterosexual at the time. We have proven that these practices only cause HARM and any potential benefit it has is overshadowed by immediate damage caused by isolation and discrimination. Trans kids need more aid not punishment out of paranoid unfounded fears. This witch hunt against trans people is an assault on US citizens. “A lack of policies and practices that affirm and support LGBT youth—and a failure to implement protections that do exist—means that LGBT students nationwide continue to face bullying, exclusion, and discrimination in school, putting them at physical and psychological risk and limiting their education. In 2001, Human Rights Watch published Hatred in the Hallways: Violence and Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Students in US Schools. The report documented rampant bullying and discrimination against LGBT students in schools across the country, and urged policymakers and school officials to take concrete steps to respect and protect the rights of LGBT youth.” © 2016 Mariam Dwedar for Human Rights Watch",129530,9/26/22  10:37am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129530

"Vanessa Dominguez, PhD, LPC, LMFT ",I STRONGLY OPPOSE THE GUIDANCE,"As a licensed professional counselor and counselor educator with a large public institution in the state, I STRONGLY OPPOSE the guidance being suggested by Gov. Youngkin. A recent study by the Trevor Project found that 45% of LGBTQIA+ youth have strongly considered attempting suicide in the past year, with BIPOC youth reporting even higher numbers. Students who report having a safe and affirming school environment report lower rates of suicide than their peers who report having hostile ones. Furthermore, less than 1 out of 3 transgender and non-binary students report having a safe and affirming home environment - which makes having a safe school environment imperative to their wellbeing. The policies suggested by Gov. Youngkin will put all LGBTQIA+ youth at continued risk for mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and suicide.

There are probably only 14 trans kids going into this school, and making it so that they have to be outed to their families who may not support them only puts these kids in danger. The 2021 model policy seemed just perfectly fine. It offered guidance on how to handle trans kids and it gave them the agency to handle their identity in the best way. This new policy is only going to open the door up for further harassment. There are homes out there that would be especially cruel and hostile to trans kids, and those kids need a place where they can feel safe and comfortable. They are going to school for an education, not to feel that they are in danger or that they’re in some big war zone. The schools need to be the safest possible environment possible for those kids, so that they can focus on getting a good education. These kids don’t need the schools or the government to go sticking their dirty fingers into their private lives because some misguided politicians think that they know best. This is ridiculous. It’s ghoulish. The teachers are there to teach not act like the trans snopes, out to nark on random kids.

Rob ,Strongly OPPOSE the 2022 guidance document,"The 2022 draft policies will erase trans and non-binary youth from the classroom and create a hostile and even dangerous school environment. They restrict restroom access and sports participation for transgender and nonbinary students, require faculty and staff to “out” trans and nonbinary students to their parents, and prohibit teachers and staff from supporting trans students in a range of ways, including blocking them from using a student’s affirming name and pronouns. Further, to require such parental notification even for the student's choice of a nickname is absurd.  Of course, all parents should be confident that our laws will ensure their children’s safety, protection, and freedom. But the Virginia Department of Education proposes to reject those values and to advance a policy that would target trans and non-binary kids for bullying and mistreatment just because of who they are. It is well-known and understood that some, if not many parents will abuse or even reject children who are ""outed"" by their teachers, school counselors or administrators.

Anonymous ,disgusting.,"(copy/pasted from my email to the governor. tw// suicide, cw// abortion, religion, & transphobia mentions.) Did you know that 40% of all transgender individuals attempt suicide in their lifetimes? As of 2022, about 1.5 million Americans identify as transgender--that's 640,000 lives on the line.The CDC reports that in 2019, 629,898 people had abortions.By these data, the transgender suicide rate nationwide is overall higher than the abortion rate.I don't understand how you can look the other way as 640,000 innocent people end their lives over something they cannot control, but fight to keep the number of abortions at 0. I am asking you to keep reading. This is a difficult pill to swallow, but ignoring this email is the difference between life and death for some trans people. Are you willing to risk their lives? The lives of children? According to the National Library of Medicine, ""The present study examines the influence of intervenable risk factors [...] and protective factors: school belonging, family support, and peer support on both lifetime suicide attempts and past 6-month suicidality in a sample of transgender youth (n = 372)."" This sentence explains that one of the major variables NLM studied was the impact of school belonging on transgender youth, indicating that it has a significant effect on them. It's not possible to determine the individual specific cause of suicide for every transgender person, of course, but we can deduce that school belonging has a large impact on transgender lives. Beyond the statistics, I have had personal experiences with suicide and suicidal thoughts. When I first suspected I may be transgender, I prayed to God every chance I could to take the thoughts away. He did not. On a personal note, I've considered killing myself because of my gender identity before. I have been given a suicide action plan. Your laws will only condemn me and hundreds of thousands of other transgender youth to pain at school and an increased risk of committing suicide.

It is wrong for schools and teachers to ""hide"" information from parents. Parents have a right to know what their children are doing in school, from their grades to their friends to everything. How can a mother or father or grandparent effectively parent their child without the knowledge of what is going on in that child's life? I have a 4 year old grandson about to begin pre-k, I have honestly considered homeschooling him due to the current policy and because I NEVER want my grandson to learn in school about transgender and non-binary and make a decision about his life without all of the information I believe he should have. I will love my grandson regardless of his chosen sexual orientation, I just don't think he is mature enough to make that decision in elementary school, especially without my guidance!!

Youngkin's roll back is dangerous and unacceptable on so many levels. Schools should be welcoming and inclusive, not exclusionary.  The main concern should be on students learning, and what we can do to ensure that they are getting the best educaiton. If, as folx have been saying, we need to get students caught back up because of pandemic learning, then we need to focus on that. Students who feel threatened or not welcomed, will not come to school creating an even larger learning deficit.  We are literally talking about life and death for some of these students. Recent surveys show that transgender and non-binary students are far more likely to commit suicide than other students. Much of the most recent data on this is from the Trevor Project and CDC, linked below. A quick google search will let you know how important it is to protect these youth who identify as Trans and Non-Binary AS WELL AS all of the other LGBTQ+ youth.   We owe them support, love, and dignity...not.",,9/26/22  10:45am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129600

Katherine ,Trans Rights are NOT Anti-Parent,"The new 2022 guidance regarding transgender students assumes that in order to support parents' rights, they have to be informed of all decisions pertaining to their child. We don't do this with other things - we don't get parental consent before serving children lunch or assigning homework or going outside to play. This isn't really about parents' rights at all - it's about limiting the ability of transgender students to be themselves, particularly when parents and caregivers are not supportive of their students. If a parent/caregiver were abusing their child, we wouldn't ask for consent before having them talk to a school psychologist. We would act in the best interest of the child - we would PROTECT the child. Yes, I am comparing not supporting a transgender student to abuse. There are consequences when transgender students don't feel the support and acceptance for who they are. There is research on this which the VDOE has completely ignored in their willingness to pander to a handful of right-wing politicians and extremists who feel that it is their job to suppress the rights of others.

"Fairfax Resident, Student, and Healthcare Provider ",Unacceptable targeting of an already at-risk population,"Transgender and gender non-conforming (GNC) youth face a disproportionately higher risk of negative physical and mental health impacts. These policies are in direct opposition to activist groups and educators who work daily to improve public education and address alarming gaps in inclusivity within our public institutions. As of 9/6/2022, at least 28 transgender individuals in the United States were recorded as victims in violent homicide cases. This number steadily grows as a result of hate, lack of education, and that of policies that fail to protect transgender and GNC youth as they seek to grow within our public education system. These policies WILL result in a significant increase of both in-public, institutional, and at-home harm for students. Forcing teachers and students into a constant dance of regulations will remove the limited protections that were in place for students that come to public institutions (i.e. students who have a lack of resources or face domestic violence in their homes). Inclusivity should be at the forefront of this discussion, and our governor should prioritize ALL youth that he claims to protect.    For information on inclusivity and anti-transgender violence, please read (it doesn't take a genius to use Google and find these sources):  https://www.hrc.org/news/hrc-mourns-dede-ricks-black-transgender-woman-killed-in-detroit https://vawnet.org/sc/serving-trans-and-non-binary-survivors-domestic-and-sexual-violence/violence-against-trans-and https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2021 https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/14054?autologincheck=redirected?nfToken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000    ",,9/26/22  10:49am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129626

This does not refer to how a public school must function. If parents want to dictate how their child thinks, behaves and is referred to then they must then invest in home schooling or any number of private schools that will indoctrinate these children to their way of thinking. This new set of guidelines will allow parents to bring their beliefs into the classrooms and usurp the authority of the teachers and administration by breaking the trust bond between the students and staff. As teachers and parents, it is our duty to raise children to be independent. It is our duty to raise people who can think for themselves and act accordingly. This new set of guidelines is a misguided attempt at indoctrinating our children to conform rather than be independent thinkers.

Robin Davis ,"Oppose This Cruel, Inhumane Policy That Will Harm Children","I strongly oppose this proposed policy that tramples the rights and safety of trans and gender-conforming students. In its zeal to protect the rights of parents Virginia is overlooking that schools ought to be focused on making sure that STUDENTS flourish. Forbidding students to express themselves and explore their gender identities without written permission from their parents and requiring schools and teachers to tell parents information that students wish to keep private is needlessly cruel and excessive government interference and red tape. The rights of parents do not supersede the rights of students. We should respect that students know their own families and home situations better than state legislators do; if a student has not shared sensitive information with their parents they likely have a REASON for that and their concerns should be respected.    This policy is going to get children hurt and killed if it goes into effect, both from self harm and psychological distress and from family abuse. Do not do this. ",129643,9/26/22  10:50am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129643
Kate Gilles ,Revisions will harm youth,"I am very concerned about the revisions to the Department of Education's Model Policy that revoke protections and support for transgender and gender non-conforming youth. These revisions create an environment of shame and hostility for gender diverse young people and compounds the risks they already face, including anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and isolation from peers and supportive adults. To be clear, those risks are not inherent to diverse gender identity but are a result of society's discrimination toward gender diverse people.  I urge Governor Youngkin and the Department of Education to repeal these revisions and instead institute a Model Policy that offers greater protections and support for all young people, including and especially those who are gender diverse. ",129644,9/26/22  10:50am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129644

Anonymous former Virginian ,Very strongly oppose because I love Virginia ,"I'm 54 years old, and grew up in Front Royal. I love the fields, rivers, the forests and mountains of my home. It broke my heart to love a place so much, and to be so unwelcome among the kids I grew up with, and victimized by parents and adults I’d never met. I was then, as now, transgender. I didn’t know other trans people existed until adulthood. Despite not having a name for it, or even understanding why, I was the target of slurs, bullying, and violence. Called a ‘,’ ‘queerbait,’ ‘cocksucker,’ starting in first grade. Teachers laughed, said they were praying for me, that I had to toughen up. I was pulled out of classes with other kids in 5th grade because one of the teachers didn’t want “that little  in my class.” They threatened to hold me back a year if I didn’t stop ‘acting like a girl.’ But the thing is, I wasn’t acting. That was almost forty years ago. I left home, transitioned- which for me was the beginning of a long, successful, and extremely happy life. But the scars of my first 18 years on this Earth are deep, and it hurts so deeply to know that the place I grew up has not only not changed, but that the cruelty I endured has been polished and made official state policy. ",129647,9/26/22  10:51am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129647

My child is nonbinary and though their journey to personal identity has been challenging, I cannot imagine how much more difficult it would have been without their 100% parental and school support through their adolescence. No child should have suicidal thoughts in our state because they fear acceptance from their community. This proposal makes the fear a reality and clearly states that anyone who is different is not accepted. Every person deserves the right to feel safe. Other people's comfort level is a non-issue in comparison to one person's actual physical safety. Trans kids are not rapists. Show me one evidence-based study that suggests that conclusion. Meanwhile, the research on the dangers trans kids face in an intolerant community are evident in the disproportionate numbers of suicide and self-harm that this group suffers. Educate yourself.

JM ,Strongly Agree with this new guidance,"I am not a Republican.  I am a lifelong Democrat.  Based on that, I'm told that I'm supposed to find this new guidance hateful.  However, I find myself strongly agreeing with this new guidance.  My school district in Central Virginia currently has policies stating that my middle school age child can change her name, pronouns, and gender at school all without me as a parent being notified if my child asks for this information to be kept from me.  Further, the policies in our school district state that they will give my child counseling to help her make these transitions, again without any notification to me as a parent if my child asks that I not be notified.  That is an absolutely insane policy.  At 12 years old, my child (and all children) lack the cognitive development to make these life changing decisions without my guidance.  My 12 year old thinks bed time should be a choice, that dessert is acceptable for dinner, that she should be able to go where she wants when she wants, and many other simple things that I as a parent must help guide and direct.  A life changing decision as important as altering gender is clearly something that as a parent, I need to be able to discuss with my child and provide guidance given the clearly not-fully-matured cognitive state present at this age.  The proper upbringing of my child is my parental right.  Schools do NOT have the right to keep important life decisions private from parents.   Further, with regard to bathroom and locker rooms, my district's policy currently states that students can use the facilities of preference and that alternative arrangements will be made for those who this makes uncomfortable.  This policy makes it clear that ""comfort"" is the driving issue.  But whose comfort should be respected?  If a private changing room is adequate for students made uncomfortable by a biological male entering a girls locker room, or a biological female entering a male locker room, than why is it not adequate for that student who is uncomfortable using the locker room matching his or her own biological gender?  Clearly, providing a private space to anyone uncomfortable with utilizing the facilities matching biological gender is a reasonable accommodation.  If this reasonable accommodation is not enough, than the only logical conclusion if we follow the current path to the end is to allow all students to utilize whatever locker room they choose regardless of biological or stated gender, or to remove locker rooms entirely and have all students change clothes out in the open.  Given that this topic is one of ""comfort"" and that somebody will be uncomfortable no matter what policy is put in place, the only logical path forward is to choose the policy that minimizes the number of uncomfortable individuals.  That path is to maintain division of facilities based on biological gender.",129658,9/26/22  10:53am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129658

"Beth O'Connor, Virginia Rural Health Association ",Virginia Must Increase Protective Factors for Students,"The Virginia Rural Health Association is troubled by the new guidelines announced by Governor Younkin that address parental rights for transgender students.  VRHA remains committed to the health and wellbeing of all rural Virginians, inclusive of mental health.  VRHA launched our Pride of Rural Virginia initiative last year and is aware that support and resources for LGBTQIA+ youth is harder to access in our rural communities.   The new guidelines state parents must be informed and given the opportunity to object before the school provides counseling services related to gender.  The implementation of this restriction will mean that parents who are unsupportive of their transgender child can refuse counseling services for the student.  Additionally, notifying the parents may increase the potential of a student being verbally or emotionally abused by a non-supportive parent.   The University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center recently released the policy brief “Key Informant Perspectives on Supporting Health and Well-Being for LGBTQ+ Rural Residents.”  That document outlines a number of barriers to health equity for our LGBTQIA+ citizens with lack of services and an unsupportive environment listed first.  “Discrimination is not uniquely rural, but when it happens in rural the impact is much more profound” stated one respondent.   The majority of Virginia’s rural communities are classified as Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas by the US Human Resources and Services Administration.  Virginia must increase protective factors that prevent mental health crisis for all community members.    Research suggests that among LGBTQ youth, only one-third experience parental acceptance, with an additional one-third experiencing parental rejection, and the final one-third not disclosing their LGBTQ identity until they are adults (Katz-Wise et al., 2015). Young adults who report high levels of parental rejection are eight times more likely to report attempting suicide and six times more likely to report high levels of depression (Ryan et al., 2009).   Many LGBTQ youth lack access to affirming spaces, with only 55% of LGBTQ youth reporting that their school is LGBTQ-affirming and only 37% saying that their home is LGBTQ-affirming. Fewer than 1 in 3 transgender and nonbinary youth found their home to be gender-affirming and a little more than half (51%) found their school to be affirming. The Trevor Project’s research consistently finds that LGBTQ young people report lower rates of attempting suicide when they have access to LGBTQ-affirming spaces.   In April of 2022, the Virginia Department of Health released the report, Self-Harm and Suicide Among Virginia Youth Aged 9-18 Years, 2015-2021.  While the report does not separate by sexual orientation or gender identity, it has a number of troubling statistics, including:   The Commonwealth of Virginia should work to reduce factors that lead to self-harm and suicide, particularly in rural areas where resources are limited.  Ideally, a student would have both supportive parents and a supportive school environment.  The new guidelines create an environment in which a student may not have either.",129686,9/26/22  10:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129686

I had hoped to make it to 40 but the stress of a political response to public health policy and the anxiety over policies enacted in my state with regard to “CRT”, transgender students being banned from sports and the restrictions on literature that disproportionately excludes the voices of Black authors, LGBTQ authors who are only quite recently even being published, the angry parents voices who scream that teachers are “groomers” - it all became far too much for me to endure in an increasingly thankless profession. Some of you may be delighted that you have driven me away, despite my having successfully taught the highest levels of mathematics, while earning advanced degrees (the only way we have to increase our salaries) and sending thousands of students on to the best universities with a foundation for success. I was openly gay throughout my career. I didn’t speak of it in the classroom but I stifled all racism, homophobia, or sexism as it occurred. My classroom was always a safe space. I also sponsored a Pride organization for LGBTQ+ students and I have come to know and advocate for hundreds of these students. We engendered a culture in my school that intentionally and proactively included LGBTQ students. This is not to say that we solved anything - there were still incidences of bullying and hatred, particularly to the most intersectional of our students. But, we had an administration with a consciousness around these issues and they were addressed. It wasn’t Utopia but every inch of progress is so deeply felt and appreciated by the students who are marginalized. What I cannot understand is what real threat you believe we present to your children. My Pride Coalition only asked to be accepted and respected. We weren’t handing toasters out in the cafeteria, trying to recruit people to become LGBTQ. We only wanted allies, to be heard, to see ourselves represented. Why is it so hard for you to just leave us alone?",129688,9/26/22  10:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129688
Catherine Casey MD ,Youngkin's proposed policy change violates civil rights and best practices in medicine.,"We are the healthcare professionals who take care of Virginia’s children and families, dedicating our lives to serving you and your children in your greatest moments of need. Rooted in our tenets of healing, beneficence, and self-determination, we are called to advocate for the transgender and gender-diverse youth for whom we care, who will be irreparably harmed if the proposed 2022 Model Policies on Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools comes into fruition.   Affirming a child’s gender identity, whether at home, at the doctor’s, or in school, is crucial to the child’s health and wellbeing. We know the statistics, that in 2021, over half of all transgender and gender-diverse youth considered killing themselves, and one in five attempted suicide.  But for us, these statistics are more than numbers; they are the names and faces and memories of children we’ve met and cared for. In their moments of hopelessness, we find hope together knowing that when a child’s identity and pronouns are honored, their suicidality lessens.   Unfortunately, the aforementioned proposed school policy enacts dangerous barriers to the safety of transgender and gender-diverse children. First, in mandating schools to inform unsupportive parents of their child’s identity, this policy obliterates the one affirming space a child may have and increases the risk of suicide and abuse by unnecessarily provoking parental hostility and rejection. Additionally, it bans any measure to affirm a child’s identity without written parental instruction by requiring school employees to use the student’s legal sex and name instead of affirming their pronouns and name. This extraordinarily harmful mandate has no legal basis. The referenced US Supreme Court cases of Troxel v Granville, Wisconsin v Yoder, and Pierce v Society of Sisters refer to matters of familial visitation and the right to withdraw from public school - not a parent’s right to deny their child’s identity and access to critical health services, such as gender counseling.   Furthermore, the proposed policy mandates students to participate in extracurricular activities and use bathrooms according to their assigned sex, despite legal precedent considering this unlawful discrimination.  In fact, this proposed policy eliminates every effort in its predecessor to create a nurturing and supportive environment, apathetic to the psychological and physical consequences to our transgender and gender-diverse youth. This policy claims that, “All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying,” yet persecutes children by denying them their identity. Any policy that directs teachers and staff to mistreat their students in this way is discriminatory at best and deadly at worst.   As Virginia’s healthcare workers, we are the ones who see children in emergency departments when they decide their lives aren’t worth living anymore, when the trauma in their bodies manifest as seizures or psychosis or debilitating pain. We are the ones who listen to these children weep as we try to convince them that their future is bright and real, that the bullying will one day be in the past, that acceptance of who they are will come. When we say that this proposed policy will devastate our children’s safety, we know from witnessing it ourselves. This policy will negatively impact the health and wellbeing of our children, leading to higher rates of suicide and self-harm, and we demand this proposal be denied.   ",129690,9/26/22  10:58am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129690

Ellen Clair Lamb ,Strongly oppose,"This policy seems unaware that the appropriate role of schools in our society is to provide education in a safe place. This idea of a ""safe place"" has been mocked by unkind people who deliberately misinterpret it, but school is often the only place vulnerable children are safe. It is critically important that schools serve as advocates for children of all kinds, and that they provide access to the support and services children need, whether or not their parents approve. If a student, for example, wants to remove a yarmulke or a hijab while in class, it is that student's right to do so, and the school has no responsibility to inform the parents of that behavior. In the same way, if a student chooses to dress or be addressed in a way that conforms to their identity, they have the right to do that, and the school has no obligation — nor really, even, any right — to inform that child's parents.  This policy will expose children to abuse at school and at home.

Patrice Comey ,This policy hurts all students.,"There is no evidence that allowing transgender students to choose bathroom or locker room facilities that correspond to their gender identity puts other students at risk. Barring transgender students from facilities that are safe, comfortable, and gender affirming is discriminatory, and that discrimination causes real harm - including increased rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidality. This policy places transgender students at heightened risk of harassment, assault, and bullying, impedes their ability to secure an education and participate fully in the life of their schools, and can cause damage to their physical and emotional health.  Virginia can and should do a better job of protecting vulnerable trans students and teaching all students the power of kindness.  A school community that is safe and kind and welcoming to ALL students will be better able to nurture those characteristics in all students.  This change in policy is based on ignorance and comes across as mean-spirited and cruel. Virginia's leadership should do the research, listen to experts, and lead with integrity to unify our communities and schools rather than dividing us through harmful policies like this one. ",129700,9/26/22  11:00am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129700

There is no moral way to do so. None. All of the other debate may still be on the table, but the fundamental, basic question has to be this:Are you OK with children killing themselves? The answer has to be ""No"" and every policy decision thereafter has to be born of that answer. Not every decision will be cut-and-dried, and not every decision will be to everyone's liking-- sometimes, we will assuredly face situations where two groups have opposing interests and that can be OK, too.But no one should die over it. ",129704,9/26/22  11:01am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129704

David Cassidy ,Stop using our children in your culture war,"It is clear that the Governor and his party are determined to use our public schools as pawns in the culture war they continue to orchestrate in service of their political and economic goals. This ""guidance"" is nothing more than ammunition for this war. It has no value in improving our schools or the welfare and education of our children. The Guidance should not be adopted, and it should be filed in the trashcan. If the Governor had interest in improving public education and our state’s economic and cultural inclusiveness, he would invest more in teacher compensation, school facilities, and social services, each of which would provide every child in Virginia with a better chance to excel for themselves and create long-term, sustainable prosperity for their families and communities. But that obviously isn’t the Governor’s interest at all. Rather, the clear, transparent goal is to eviscerate the public school system by reducing investment in it, and turning public opinion against educators and school administrators. The public school system is intended to embrace diversity of thinking, intellectual inquiry and discovery, and connection between peoples of different cultures and values. These are essential to the health and prosperity of our state and its people. But the Guidance achieves none of these goals: it limits thinking to prevailing norms that do not accommodate difference; it prohibits intellectual inquiry and discovery by demanding homogeneity and conformance; and it destroys any hope of social connection by fomenting anger and division between people of different cultures and values. It is terrible guidance, cynical politics, and clearly constructed in bad faith. It should be acknowledged for what it is: a side-show theater in service of specific political and economic goals. And those responsible for it should be ashamed of themselves and apologize to all Virginians for wasting time, money, and attention while ignoring the more pressing challenges and opportunities that Virginia faces today.",129713,9/26/22  11:02am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129713

Riley K ,Opposition to the 2022 Model Policies,I am opposed to this guidance. The guidance doesn't properly acknowledge and account for the potential harm that may be inflicted on trans students through use of pronouns or a name that they no longer identify with. With regards to the rights of the personnel; it is not and should not be protected for someone to call someone a name or pronouns that they don't identify with. Not all beliefs are constitutionally protected especially when they clash with the rights of others or involve discrimination based on a protected class. It is not permissible for someone with a belief that is against the law to assert that the belief protects them from the law and there already exist situations where school division personnel can express inappropriate beliefs or comments which cause them to lose their job even if not against the law. The proposed guidance seems to suggest that the previous model policies oppose parental involvement when they in fact encouraged it. The support of parents is an incredibly important component to ensuring that children remain safe and protected from harassment in schools (especially trans children). The policies just recognize that the parent isn't the only method of supporting children in school and that the school itself plays a large part. ,129715,9/26/22  11:03am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129715

As a cis woman, I have had the honor of loving someone who is trans and playing alongside trans athletes as a collegiate athlete on a women's team.

I hope that trans youth do not have to face these same challenges, and policies such as this one are simply heartbreaking. I ask that you speak to trans youth and to the families of trans youth who simply want their children to be able to succeed in school. Trans youth are just like any other students, they simply want to be seen and respected.

Elly Tucker ,Virginia is only as good as its most marginalized. Protect trans rights!,"I am writing today because I would like to make a public comment or at least comment about the bill Youngkin is proposing to strip away the rights of trans youth.  I am AGAINST this action! I am an ally for trans/LGBTQ and others that I can help speak for.    My son is in a committed relationship with a young trans man. We adore him. He is one of the wisest people I know. He is dedicating his life to helping other trans young people to be included in our civil society, by becoming a counselor for trans people.     Through him, I have learned that being trans is NOT a choice, it is who they are. I have also learned that many families have family members that are trans. This number is growing, as we begin as a society to learn that trans people ARE, SHOULD BE and we NEED THEM TO BE part of our society. We can learn a lot from the trans community about acceptance, facing uphill battles and conquering their fears and about loving someone for who they are.    Sadly, many trans youths are not supported in schools and at home. Many suffer debilitating depression as a result. And statistics show that fewer than 1 in 3 trans and nonbinary youth felt affirmed in their gender at home, and LGBTQ youth who felt high social support from their family reported attempting suicide at less than half the rate of those who felt low or moderate social support. The survey found that LGBTQ youth who reported their school to be LGBTQ-affirming also reported lower rates of attempting suicide. Even more alarming is the fact that 59% of transgender boys and men reported seriously considering suicide in the past year, as did 53% of nonbinary youth and 48% of transgender girls and women. 22% of transgender boys and men reported attempting suicide in the past year, compared to 6% of cisgender boys and men.   We should be better than this as a society and certainly as Virginians.    I ask that the citizens of Virginia step up and fight for the rights of all people and in this case, for members of the trans community. Certainly the governor of our state should be protecting the rights of our trans youth and adults. Let Gov.

Mark Witzel ,STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS BIGOTRY,"I strongly oppose this This guidance is a thinly veiled effort to hurt and humiliate transgender students, and I am ashamed at the backwards movement of my beloved commonwealth. First - requiring teachers to get parental permission to use nicknames is ludicrous.  Many VA teachers have 150+ students.  Many of these students have parents who speak little to no English.  It is an unnecessary burden to force teachers to call the parent of every child who doesn't want to be called the name on their birth certificate.  This will also hurt the teacher's relationship with their student, especially when peers are using a nickname that a teacher cannot use according to state guidance.  Put simply, you are creating a burden for teachers and damaging the classroom environment in your zeal to hurt transgender children. Second - being transgender is not inherently wrong.  While I agree that schools should keep parents informed when a child engages in wrong behavior (bullying, cheating, stealing, etc.) it is ridiculous to demand teachers inform parents of not-wrong behavior (diet, religion, grammar, dress, etc.).  If a child declares they are atheist in class, does that require a call home?  If a child does not wear a hijab to class who usually does, does that require a call home?  If a child eats a Twinkie, does that require a call home?  Unless the Commonwealth is prepared to argue that gender identity is more important that religion, you are placing another unnecessary burden on teachers to interfere in a child's family.  In short, leave my family out of your culture war and let teachers do their jobs and TEACH. If a child wants to be called a certain name, treat them with respect, use the name they prefer, and get back to the lesson.  When they need to go to the bathroom, let them go to the bathroom.  I can't believe I have to write this.  This is 2022.  Please don't pull us backwards.  ",129727,9/26/22  11:05am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129727

Anonymous ,Opposition to Youngkin new model policies ,"The proposed policies claim to foster privacy, dignity, and respect. They instead require changes that undermine privacy, dignity, and respect for students and their parents. The proposed policies received no public input while being drafted, were not developed in accordance with evidence-based best practices, are directly contrary to the law they purport to implement, and will put transgender and non-binary students at risk for harm and discrimination at school. The proposed policies violate the Virginia Human Rights Act. The proposed policies do not respect the parental rights of those parents who want their transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive children to live their lives safely as themselves.  Similarly, they do not respect the rights of patents and students who want to make sure VA schools provide a positive and welcoming learning environment for all.

We already acknowledge that these limits exist, which is why the state removes children from unsafe environments. Every human has a right to their own identity. If parents are concerned that their children are hiding something from them, they should look at their own parenting to answer why they don’t have an open and loving relationship. Students have a right to seek help for questions and issues they encounter in their own lives. Exploring their identity does not harm them, so there is no responsibility for a school to disclose a student’s personal business. Youngkin is not trying to help Virginians.

Morgan ,I Thought VA Was Better Than This,"As the parent of a 12 y.o. trans son, I don't get the hate. Before socially transitioning about two years ago, my kid was withdrawn, angry, and experienced suicidal ideation. Now he's outgoing, ""quirky"" (as he calls it), and happier than he's ever been. He blows everyone away with his artistic talent and last year wrapped up the 5th grade with honors. All this because he's allowed to live as himself both at home AND at school. I'm fortunate enough as a parent to not worry about his school being unsupportive or hostile. They won't deadname or misgender him, and almost nobody outside of the school administration even knows he's trans. I haven't received a call from a concerned principal about my child being ""one of those transes"". Not every trans kid is fortunate enough to have a supportive home. That's why forced outing will put kids in literal danger. Others will be forced back into the closet. If I were more pessimistic, I'd almost say that was the point. So let me set the record straight for anyone who thinks trans kids are some kind of anomaly to be suppressed. My son, and other trans kids like him, are not a wedge issue to score points with a rabid base before the midterms. They are human beings, not political props. DO.

Carolyn Trotter ,Some parents will never allow their child's transition,"The simple fact is some parents hate that their children are transgender, and they will never accept recognition of who their child really is. Their children are still trans regardless. Forcing the school system to hold up such a parent's delusion about who their child is helps nobody. A child only has so many communities. Family, school, perhaps a church/hobby/friend group outside the house if they are lucky. This change in policy means that when a family is not accepting, for the vast majority of their waking hours this person will be forced to live a lie. For years. And that's after they've got up the courage to tell someone, a trusted someone, that something feels wrong. Personally, I'm lucky enough to have an immediate family that supports my transition (been a few years, I'm 27 now). But others don't have that. And the parent able to say no to everything will, unsurprisingly, say no to everything. Every clause in this policy that defers to parents will -- in the case of bad parents who would rather pretend to raise a different, imaginary child than the one actually in front of them -- result in the school helping to shove a student right back in the closet. This isn't going to go down well. My Radical Leftist Woke Take™ is that parents should not own their children. One's life is one's own.

Ashley ,Parental Notification/Trans Student Policy ,"Rolling back the trans protections given to students in Virginia public schools is dangerous. Adding to that a parental notification policy and barrier to entry for trans students whose parents affirm their identity names and pronouns shows this has nothing to do with a parent's rights but the targeting and dehumanizing trans students. If a parent says yes to a student's name and pronoun change that should be enough to change the students name and pronouns on the rolls, in powerschool, and on student records which is the standard. Having a birth certificate and legal name change is a costly and lengthy process. This should not be the reason a trans child is denied a safe education. Affirming trans students is not only what's best for the students but the community as a whole. 82% of trans youth have considered suicide, these rates go down considerably with access to gender affirming health care, and adults who are affirming and supportive. This creates an environment that gives all students the best tools for learning readiness.  I am also the parent of a trans son. For two years before my son came out I loved in fear of finding him dead when I went to wake him up everyday. He was in therapy and in distress until he finally came out to me and his father. We love and embrace him and his trans experience. I do not want another parent to live the nightmare I lived for those two years. Though it's been four since my son came out I still have nightmares about his distress and self harm that not living fully as himself brought on. It is truly hell on Earth. We owe teachers the chance to teach without the added stress of potentially outing students to unsafe home environments and putting students in mental distress by forcing them to deadname their students. Teachers are there to teach and give social and academic tools for the students to carry into adulthood. This policy hinders that, and good educators will go elsewhere. That is will effect everyone in every community. Public School is the great equalizer and every student deserves an education that will prepare them for the future. This starts with quality educators and safe learning environments. There is a safer way if we must insist on parental notification, by utilizing the help of school counselors and mental health professionals, and listening and honoring when parents fully affirm their trans children. ",129757,9/26/22  11:12am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129757
Emili Vesilind ,OPPOSE THIS—This is bad for Virginia,"This set of policies is a huge step backward for Virginia — for its schools and larger culture. Upholding acceptance, dignity, and respect for all humans is always the ""right"" thing to do, yes (and these proposed policies do not do this). But it's also the American thing to do. This country was built on the concept that all citizens possess full rights and autonomy; these policies fly in the face of that ideal. They are anti-American, obviously bigoted, and clearly designed to pander to the far right, which craves more control of public school culture and what's being taught in schools, and how — essentially, so they can ban important, and thought-provoking literature and slice out inconvenient sections of history books (slavery, Colonialism), fundamentally teaching kids that as Americans we do not have to reckon with the past, but instead can move smugly forward with no understanding of how this country was built. As a mother of two in Fairfax Public Schools, I strongly oppose these policies, for our students and Virginia. ",129758,9/26/22  11:12am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129758
Katie Smith ,I OPPOSE this policy ,"I strongly OPPOSE this policy. Multiple peer reviewed and published studies have demonstrated that trans and non-binary youth are at increased risk of suicide and mental health issues directly related to not being accepted.  I am a school employee and a mother. In both of these roles I oppose this policy! There is no long lasting damage to allowing a student to use their preferred pronouns, name, bathroom, or sports teams but there is long lasting damage, sometime lethal, to denying this to a student! My students need acceptance and support. Denying them use of their preferred pronouns or name is a level of disrespect that no person deserves. Just in the past year I have worked with individuals who were born female but identify as male who go into deep depression, and have panic attacks every month because they feel their body betrays them. This has led to psychiatric hospitalizations to help them cope with the fact that their identity does not match with their current body. These students are not going to “change their minds” one day  this is very real for them and to tell them they need to use female pronouns and their birth name would just be cruel and worsen their mental health symptoms. Thankfully they currently go to a supportive and inclusive school and I have witnessed them grow and blossom into confident young adults since they started here. THAT is what inclusion can do for a child and is exactly what I would want for my children.  This is a huge overstep of government in a dangerous way.  I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS POLICY. ",129759,9/26/22  11:12am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129759

Concerned Virginian ,Governor Youngkin is endangering children ,"Governor Youngkin’s policies are an extreme danger to LGBTQIA youth. LGBTQIA people, even if they are children, are the only ones who should make the decisions whether they will come out as LGBTQIA, when to come out, and to whom they will come out. Teachers, school administrators, peers, and even parents cannot make these decisions for anyone other than themselves, even children entrusted to their care, not least because they may (intentionally or unintentionally) expose another person to harm. Requiring children to use restrooms of the gender they were assigned at birth, without  whether they are safe in those restrooms, will embolden bigots to hurt LGBTQIA kids and/or force LGBTQIA kids to avoid bathrooms, leading to physical pain and even long term complications. LGBTQIA children, no less than anyone else, deserve to use restrooms in which they will be safe from bigotry, harassment, and violence. They, not the governor in his faraway mansion, should be the ones to decide in which bathroom they will be safest. Requiring teachers and others to consult parents regarding the names and pronouns children want to use in school  means that LGBTQIA children will be subjected to psychological and/or physical abuse, even expulsion, from any parents they were unsafe coming out to. A large percentage of LGBTQIA minors live houseless either because their parents ejected them from their homes or because they could no longer bear the psychological and/or physical abuse to which bigoted parents subjected them. A significant number of LGBTQIA minors are killed by bigots or commit suicide because they can no longer bear the psychological and/or physical abuse to which they are subjected by parents, other authorities, and/or peers. Governor Youngkin’s policies do not create more safety for LGBTQIA children, but more dangers. LGBTQIA people, even if they are children, are the only ones who should make the decisions whether they will come out as LGBTQIA, when to come out, and to whom they will come out. They, not Governor Youngkin, not their teachers or school administrators, are the best informed about the relative safety of their own individual circumstances. Of course some LGBTQIA people make mistakes. A girl may think it’s safe to tell her mother she is trans, a boy may think it’s safe to tell his teacher he is gay, and learn too late that it was not actually safe to tell the person they chose. But it is far, far and away more dangerous to compel the sharing of personal LGBTQIA information without any regard for children’s safety, as Governor Youngkin’s policies would do.",129785,9/26/22  11:18am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129785

Emma Wiley ,Protecting Trans Kids Protects All Kids,"As someone who grew up in Virginia and spent all of my K-12 education in the Fairfax County Public Schools, I strongly oppose the changes to the Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia's Public Schools proposed by Governor Glenn Youngkin. All children, including transgender/nonbinary/questioning children, have the right to live their lives and go to school without fear of discrimination, bullying/harassment, or breach of their privacy.  By outing students or forcing them to out themselves before they desire is an act of violence. Not only does it make them more vulnerable to harassment, bullying, discrimination, and gender-based violence...it also makes the student themselves more vulnerable to depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts.  If you are worried about other cis-gender students and their safety, there is NO reliable evidence that allowing all students to use the bathroom/locker rooms/other spaces that align with their gender identity results in any more violence than forcing students to use the bathrooms of their sex-assigned-at-birth. However, forcing transgender students to out themselves or disrespecting their gender identity will result in the injury and death of children.  No matter what you think about parental rights...a parent's right to know anything about their child does not supercede a child's right to live. Governor Youngkin, I encourage you to listen to the will of the Virginia people and NOT change the 2021 Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia's Public Schools.",129790,9/26/22  11:20am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129790

"William Li (Fairfax, VA) ","Oppose Youngkin's bigoted, legally flawed, counterproductive model policy ","This policy is bigoted, legally flawed, bullies children, and creates the very problems it seeks to remedy. 1) This policy defines ""sex"" as ""biological sex"" (which this admin thinks means assigned at birth) and therefore fails to afford students equal rights. Such a definition is legally flawed and inherently biased. To be clear - this policy is discriminatory on its face. 2) This policy creates the very problems this flawed policy seeks to prevent. It would result in boys who were assigned female at birth to compete with girls and go to girls' facilities. 3) This policy bullies trans and non-binary children, when studies show that those children need the most support.  This policy is a shameful, partisan document that reflects neither reality nor policy needs. It exposes the VA GOP as an organization (and Governor Youngkin as an individual) bereft of real policy positions. Instead they seek to punish and bully the vulnerable.

Stan Dykstra ,Parental Oversight and Protection for All Students ,"Regarding Proposed Guidance for Treatment of Transgender Students:  The public school system in many jurisdictions has demonstrated an inability to protect the students in their care and has been reluctant to afford parents their natural god given right to care for their children.  Schools have been guilty of forcing an agenda on their students, while keeping parents at arms length lest they object.  The relative small number of students suffering gender confusion need parental support and appropriate professional  counseling, not interference by teachers or school staff with a motive that is not necessarily in line with the best interests of the student.  Some comments make reference to hate, but the hatred originates with those forcing unhelpful radical agendas on impressionable youth who need compassion and parental involvement.   Bullying is already handled by appropriate policies and should be sufficient if enforced by administrators. Locker rooms and bathrooms must respect the privacy of students according to their biological sex.   Sports programs must adhere to participation rules that respect biological sex.  The biological differences between male and female are too profound post-puberty to allow for fair competition.  Female competitors are at a disadvantage and should not be cheated from their fairly won achievements. This guidance supports common sense policies that protect all students and ensures that parents are kept informed and involved in the lives of their children. ",129804,9/26/22  11:22am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129804

Sonya M. ,Oppose this Legislation-Protect Transgender Students,"I oppose this legislation. I am a Christian, a member of the Episcopal church, and a mother of a teenager.  This legislation removes protections for transgender students and those who wish to help and support them.  This also targets transgender persons as unnatural and predators.  They aren't hurting anyone! Let them explore who they are. Trying to force a child into a specific gender identity – either by denial, punishment, reparative therapy, or any other tactic – is not only ineffective; it is dangerous. It can do permanent damage to a child’s mental health. This legislation will lead to more trans youth being targets of hate crimes or trans youth becoming depressed and suicidal.   My daughter has 2 friends who are transgender. One has a family that fully supports the transition and one whose family firmly does not support it at all.  We have watched these 2 families deal with trans issues for nearly a decade. The supports at schools, and the SAFE environment at schools in Fairfax county have- LITERALLY-saved the lives of their children. For the family that did not support their child being trans, the counseling and care their child received saved them from suicide. While speaking to the mother, even though her faith does not recognize trans or homosexuality, she is glad that her child is alive, and she concedes that without the help of the school system, her child would have died.   This law will kill children if passed.

"Ryan Nadeau, VCU Student ","Strongly oppose, more harm than good","This legislation was originally invented to protect transgender students from discriminatory behavior. Governor Youngkin has taken it and turned it into guidelines that do the exact opposite. These guidelines restrict our students rather than give them personal autonomy, create dangerous situations rather than avoid them, and generate conflict between educators and administration, students, and families rather than mitigate it.  Why must we waste educators' and administrators' time by forcing them to police every student attempting to use the restroom? Why are we creating guidelines that, with their broad strokes and verbiage, essentially require educators to make a phone call home when even Thomas wants to go by Tommy? When did our schools become less of a haven for students, and more of a battlefield within which our students have to fear consequences for simply living their truth? It is proven fact that transgender students are more at risk for depression and suicide than their cisgender counterparts. If we allow these guidelines to go into affect, we are not ""giving parents their constitutional rights back"". We are, in fact, not only stripping our students of the right to safely learn, but we are directly risking their health and wellness. This is a direct invasion of privacy and an overextension of the rights of school officials. It is an overextension of the rights of the office of the governor, frankly.

But there is more than that. 64% of transgender students have reported avoiding a class because they feel unsafe. Is it, or is it not, the policy of the Commonwealth to guarantee all children a safe place to receive a public education? Because these policies will force students into a place where they feel unsafe and unsupported, and these youth will feel compelled to skip classes or leave school altogether - you are effectively denying them their right to an education by not providing them a safe place to learn. Policies that deny trans youth the right to express their true identity are policies that lead to more than half of transgender and non-binary youth to attempt suicide in the last year. The policies proposed will kill children. Meanwhile there is basically zero evidence to show that allowing transgender or nonbinary students access to bathrooms or locker rooms that match their identity will have any negative effect on other students, whereas there is very real evidence that forcing transgender youth to use facilities that don't match their identity puts them in danger of bullying and harassment, up to and including assault.

I am the Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for Waynesboro Public Schools.   I would like to raise serious concerns regarding these model policies.  In my locale, there are approximately 90 transgender and gender-expansive students. These policies would directly negatively impact their daily lives by denying them the ability to safely express themselves and be affirmed for who they are. These students are deserving of protection and support. The suicide rate for transgender youth is already extremely high. 52% of trans youth seriously considered suicide, while 21% attempted suicide in the past year. This problem is preventable, but the new model policies would exacerbate the issue by denying students life-saving social transitions at school. The Trevor Project explains that “transgender and nonbinary youth who reported having pronouns respected by all or most people in their lives attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected.” This statistic shows that honoring students’ chosen names and pronouns is a crucial form of suicide prevention.  Moreover, as much as we would like to imagine that all parents are supportive of their children no matter their gender identity, educators see that this is unfortunately not the case: Transgender youth are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, in part because they are often kicked out of their homes or abandoned by caregivers due to their trans identity. The Trevor Project states that “38% of transgender girls/women, 39% of transgender boys/men, and 35% of nonbinary youth reported housing instability and homelessness.” By requiring educators such as teachers and guidance counselors to automatically inform parents of their child’s transgender identity if the student comes out at school, the state puts young people in a position where they must either suppress their identities entirely or risk the roof over their heads.  In summary, these new policies would in reality deny students the privacy, dignity, and respect they deserve. Schools have an important role in supporting the mental health and safety of their transgender and nonbinary students. As an educator dedicated to creating learning environments where everyone can thrive, I urge you to reject or, at the very least, substantially revise these model policies to protect trans youth.  Sincerely, Kendra Jones Carter B.S.ed/M.T.  https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2020/?section=Introduction  https://www.thetrevorproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Trevor-Project-Homelessness-Report.pdf  ",,9/26/22  11:29am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129828

Nicholas Cherneski ,I Strongly Oppose This Course Of Action ,"When speaking about transgender people, we have to acknowledge that there are some people who will engage in violent behavior with them when unprovoked. Forcibly outing transgender people will make them targets, and can lead to loss of life. Also, preventing these transgender people from engaging in use of preferred pronouns and names only harms the transgender people. It does nothing to protect anybody and only serves to delegitimize transgender people's lives and existences. As for bathroom policy; if your fear is that someone will prey on others in a bathroom because of there attraction to the people in that bathroom, are you going to interrogate all students and force them to out their sexuality to you and then prevent homosexuals from using the bathroom of their preference? And more importantly, people go to the bathroom to use the bathroom, and we all go to the bathroom.   This policy will only cause harm to transgender people and give peace of mind to bigoted people. It also brings up more questions, and possibly restricts more people from being able to live true and free in our society.

Brittany Rose ,Strongly opposed to these model policies,"As the parent of public school children in Virginia, I strongly oppose these proposed 2022 model policies. The policies purport to support privacy, dignity, and respect for all students in Virginia. In fact, in the purpose it explicitly states ""All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying."" All students includes trans and non-binary students. The guidance document further states that ""The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological belief."" The existence of trans and non-binary people is NOT an ideological belief. To say that teachers and staff are permitted to misgender a student because of personally held beliefs is not compatible with providing an educational environment ""free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying"" for all students. Section 22.1-23.3 of the Code of Virginia, held up in the guidance document under statutory authority and requirements, instructs that ""The Department of Education shall develop and make available to each school board model policies concerning the treatment of transgender students in public elementary and secondary schools that address common issues regarding transgender students in accordance with evidence-based best practices."" The proposed 2022 model policies are in direct conflict with well established evidence-based best practices related to trans and non-binary youth. These policies will harm children, and more specifically children who are already marginalized and often struggle to find acceptance in a world that increasingly uses them for political grandstanding purposes.",129832,9/26/22  11:29am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129832

Eve German ,Protect Trans Kids,"Every child should have the right to be safe in school, safe from bullying by other children and safe from bullying by teachers and administrative staff. Youngkin is proposing changes that make all of our children less safe, including those who are not trans or nonbinary. Any time a government allows or supports oppressing a group of people, bullying and violence follows. Bullying is harmful to transgender and nonbinary kids, obviously. But it's also bad for the children and adults who do the bullying, making it difficult for them to acquire healthy social skills and maintain healthy relationships that help them get better jobs and avoid prison. The American Academy of Pediatrics and many other medical groups oppose discriminatory policies like Youngkin's because they know that transgender and nonbinary children need support from their parents and communities. Transgender and nonbinary children who are loved and supported have a much better chance to not only survive, but thrive. We must stop Youngkin from turning our schools into places where some children are forced to hide and some children are encouraged to bully others. ",129848,9/26/22  11:33am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129848

No Longer Moving to Virginia ,Shameful and hateful ,"As someone who had previously been seriously considering a move to Virginia, this policy now makes it an undesirable place to live. I would be ashamed to know that my elected representatives have so much hate in their hearts, and I see it as my duty to protect children, all children. What you propose is the opposite of protection. Transgender children not only exist, but deserve love, support through a variety of means, and a community that not only acknowledges their existence but celebrates it. Anyone competent in simple and basic research who hasn’t been poisoned by conspiracy theorists can see that no young children are being given hormones or offered surgery, that puberty blockers have been used for decades in the case of precocious puberty with no ill effects, that only a small minority of children identifying as transgender change their mind and that they experience no damage from the freedom of self-determination,, that children who are supported are less likely to experience major mental health crises, and that the movement to mark the transgender community as groomers is nothing more than a self-revealing bid by the far-right to pin blame on a community they don’t understand. We have more cases of ELECTED MALE OFFICIALS committing assault and misconduct in single-sex bathrooms than we do cases of people pretending to be transgender for the purpose of assaulting women and girls in any same-sex bathrooms  Ask yourself why that is, and what values the right holds that could lead to this phenomenon.  Lastly, take a look deep down and ask yourself who is really protecting children, and who wants to keep their subjugated under their thumbs for further exploitation.  Luke 10:25-37",129852,9/26/22  11:34am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129852

They are learning to be individuals in this setting, and learning what their boundaries are and what their identities and morals will become. Let them continue this exploration and trust that the teachers and administration will notify you if anything truly disturbing or out of line happens.  Teachers care.

Mallory Graydon ,Stop this unevidenced pogrom against TGD youth,"The proposed replacement of sensible, evidence based model policy for the treatment of transgender and gender-diverse children (TGD) in schools is without scientific merit and will lead to lasting harm and death. The proposal, offered entirely without evidential support, appears to be the result of politicians attempting to curry favor by sacrificing a vulnerable and powerless minority to bigots in exchange for their support. Not only should this proposal be rejected, everyone involved in drafting it should be subjected youth to Nuremberg-style trials. The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has released standards of care (SoC) based on a thorough review of the available evidence concerning TGD persons (https://www.wpath.org/soc8). This guidance is at odds with nearly every aspect of the proposed model policy. Where the WPATH SoC regonizes the importance of respecting individuals' chosen names and pronouns, the model policy forces deadnaming and misgendering for some TGD youth and allows deadnaming and misgendering by any member of staff who feels like it. Where the WPATH SoC reccomends that ""institutional personnel establish housing policies that ensure the safety of TGD residents without segregating or isolating these individuals,"" the proposed guidance takes a separate and unequal approach, attempting to relegate TGD youth to either wrong-gender-associated facilities or isolated facilities that would only serve to stigmatize youth who use them. Where the WPATH SoC notes that youth with unsupportive parents might require care from third parties, the model guidance aims to let bigoted parents prohibit TGD children from even expressing their gender identity openly at school. The SoC elaborates: ""Helping youth and parent(s)/caregiver(s) work together on important gender care decisions is a primary goal. However, in some cases, parent(s)/caregiver(s) may be too rejecting of their adolescent child and their child’s gender needs to be part of the clinical evaluation process. In these situations, youth may require the engagement of larger systems of advocacy and support to move forward with the necessary support and care."" Promoting the opposite of an evidence-based policy will have disastrous effects for Virginia's TGD youth. Again, per the SoC: ""Russell et al. (2018) found mental health improvement increases with more acceptance and affirmation across more settings (e.g., home, school, work, and friends). Rejection by family, peers, and school staff (e.g., intentionally using the name and pronoun the youth does not identify with, not acknowledging affirmed gender identity, bullying, harassment, verbal and physical abuse, poor relationships, rejection for being TGD, eviction) was strongly linked to negative outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and substance use (Grossman et al., 2005; Klein & Golub; 2016; Pariseau et al., 2019; Peng et al., 2019; Reisner, Greytak et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2013). It is important to be aware that negative symptoms increase with increased levels of rejection and continue into adulthood (Roberts et al., 2013)"" This proposal clearly violates the Virginia code's requirement for an evidence-based policy. Since the proposed policy can only harm TGD youth for no conceivable benefit, it is reasonable to conclude that it commits that harm deliberately. The people who had anything to do with formulating this should be removed and forever banned from holding any positions of power: they have faced a moral test and failed spectacularly, whether by instigating this violence towards TGD youth or by failing to prevent it.",,9/26/22  11:35am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129862

Joe Silva ,"Please don't allow ""gender affirming"" surgery!!","Hello, I would like to comment on the proposal for transgender policy in our school system.  No human has ever changed their gender or altered it in the slightest. Chromosomes determine gender at conception. One's gender is expressed in every cell in one's body. There's no way to change one's chromosomes. So the scientific reality is that the 'transgender' movement is a FRAUD. Kids should not be taught the falsehood that their gender is fluid or flexible. An even more serious problem is the fact that Biden's administration has okayed ""gender affirming"" surgery. This is a very dangerous and damaging procedure that should be outlawed in all cases. There's no way to affect one's gender through surgery! That's an absolute fiction. All surgical alterations are COSMETIC ONLY! And they have many negative side-effects, including sterility.

James Boswell ,Support the 2022 policy,"The new policy returns some balance to the treatment of all children in our education system. The requirements for recognition of transgender status are not onerous, but rightly involve the parents as well as the child. These policies recognize that non transgender students also have rights - including the right to bodily privacy. No general locker room, group showers, lodgings, or other such facilities should require a child of one sex to be exposed to or in front of a child of the other sex, regardless of the chosen gender identity. The 2022 policy factors in the nature of many school facilities and the need to protect the individual rights of all students. In addition, the requirement to include parents in any accommodations is a protection to the child - just as requiring parental consent prior to medical treatment or even being out of school for an activity. The 2021 policy was geared to enlarge the role of teachers in guiding children - regardless of parental choice. This needed to be changed for the good of families. ",129896,9/26/22  11:41am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129896

Why is it the business of the governor to discourage anyone, at any age, from experimenting with their gender expression? Trans people aren't hurting anybody, they're just trying to live their lives. If the parents of their fellow students have a problem with their own non-trans kids being exposed to this- a fear that I don't think is reasonable to act on, you can't hide the world from your kid forever- they can change schools or homeschool. I'm willing to bet my next paycheck that the problem is all the parents' and the kids don't care much; kids are resilient and open-minded. Maybe the parents making such a big stink about the possibility of their kid ever coming into contact with a trans person are just afraid they won't have complete control anymore over whose humanity and dignity their child is capable of seeing and accepting.

Alex (I work for an employer based in Virginia) ,Oppose in the Strongest Possible Terms,"The proposed regulation is equal parts poor policy, poor understanding of the law, and poor execution of the VA constitution. Forcing agents of the state- in this case, educators and school staff- to put the lives and well-being of children at risk in the name of ""parental rights"" is at best tactless, and at worst, evil. There are likely enough emotional and experiential arguments being levied against the proposed regulation, hence I will rely on the law. The rule change in question would violate principally 1) Section 1 of the Virginia Bill of Rights, and 2) United States Supreme Court Precedent vested in Tinker v Des Moines, and affirmed in Morse v Frederick. Section 1 of the Virginia Bill of Rights states that ""That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety."" Effectively, all persons entering the ""state of society"" of Virginia, have the ingrained, and un-assailable right to life, freedom, and whatever brings them happiness, and safety. Does the Governor's Office truly believe that this right does not extend to students in the classroom? Is denial of the right to use the facilities one most feels comfortable with the fair exercise of a Virginian's guarantee to liberty, and personal safety? How would the Governor feel if he were a Virginia student, and the school and his parents were insistent by calling him by his middle name, ""Allen?"" Would Allen- sorry Glenn- sorry, Governor Youngkin sit back and let that continue? No, the argument that would be made before courts is that his name is ""Glenn,"" he goes by ""Glenn,"" and he's not ""Allen Youngkin,"" even though his parents might think so. Are you truly to deny Virginians the basic freedom to identify themselves, as guaranteed- again- by your own bill of rights. ""All persons have the right to freedom and whatever brings them Happiness and Safety."" What if, in this hypothetical, Youngkin felt unsafe using the name ""Allen,"" or if it brought him great personal or emotional distress? ""Allen was the name of the uncle that got drunk one night and ate my favorite horse."" Why would we insist that we retraumatize Governor Youngkin in remembrance of his beloved pony? Is that not the state denying him his basic rights? The next argument: The Supreme Court of the United States has twice affirmed the rights of students in similar circumstances as per Tinker v. Des Moines, and Morse v. Frederick. In Tinker, SCOTUS found that students have the right to ""express their rights to free speech, so long as it does not interrupt the due course of education."" This was modified in Morse, because ""bong hits 4 Jesus"" likely interrupts the due course of education, in that having a banner that says ""do drugs"" at a school-sanctioned event, interferes with the due course of learning. Likewise, forcing a student to use the facilities or the name- that as stated above, would cause serious emotional harm- interferes with that student's ability to participate in the due course of education. I know where the counterargument will come from, and allow me to dismantle it in the clearest way I can: a transgender or gender non-conforming student using the restroom that closely corresponds with their identity, or using the name and pronouns that do the same, does not interfere with the school's ability to teach. The people who say ""well what about people who lie about being transgender so they can be creeps in the bathroom"" appear to lack the facilities to understand that they'll be able to tell when someone's lying about their identity so they can be creeps. A trans kid that wants to pee is a trans kid that wants to pee. The state (commonwealth, whatever) has no business in needlessly over-policing that student on the assumption that they MIGHT be stating that to do something malicious. Or does the presumption of innocence not apply to transgender Virginians? The over-policing of a student's identity represents the clearer and more present threat to their ability to learn. The state is more than capable of adequately identifying and punishing people who abuse the system, and the assumption of good faith. As far as the ""role of the parent"" goes in this argument, the aforementioned court cases affirm the dual roles of the state in taking care of children when educating them, and what the roles of parents are. The assumption is that the school will take care of a child's basic needs- food, shelter, safety, and the rights granted to them by state, local, and national law. The reality herein, is that the role of a ""parent"" changes when a child is at school. Fulfillment of basic needs still applies- but because the school is an agent of government, it must afford the student the rights that government guarantees: life, liberty, health, and safety among them. To use the earlier analogy, Governor Youngkin's parents insisting that his name is ""Allen"" is of no issue to the state, when it is out of the jurisdiction of the state. However, as soon as the Governor steps into a public school, he is, by extension, under the care of the state. Hence, the state cannot levy discomfort and emotional harm to him by insisting that his name is ""Allen,"" forcing him to re-live the trauma of finding his succulent slow-roasted pony that fateful day.  In summary, the regulation proposal is bad. Like, really bad. For these basic reasons: 1) it will cause undue and unnecessary harm to students that  2) likely violates the VA bill of rights, insofar as it denies the rights to liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and 3) likely violates SCOTUS precedent in that the policing of a student's identity denies the right to an education as affirmed in Tinker and Morse. As a point of personal privilege, I would like to address the Governor directly. Mr. Youngkin, I don't know who is in your ear saying that you can become a Senator, or a Cabinet Official, or the President of the United States, but they are lying to you. Yes, they are lying to you. You're a wealthy guy- I'll give you that, you'll probably see more money in the next couple of years than I can even imagine touching in my lifetime. But you need to fire the consultants who say that pandering to the most vile elements of the right-wing, and levying violence on children- children in MY community- is politically good for you. You are not going to do well in the 2024 or 2028 Republican Primary. You're going to finish a distant second or third place in New Hampshire on 10, 11 percent, because the GOP heart wants what it wants- and it wants Donald Trump again, or it wants Ron DeSantis. Hell, maybe even Ivanka or Don Jr. It doesn't want Glenn Youngkin. They're going to see you as an out of touch rich guy from a liberal state. Yes, Virginia is a purplish state, but you're going to be given the same treatment as my governor, Larry Hogan. You're already a RINO. You're already old news, a guy who just doesn't get it. Spare yourself the embarrassment and the guilt, and take a lesson from your Republican Governor colleague a state away. Heed the advice of a Spencer Cox, an Eric Holcomb, hell even a Doug Burgum, in understanding that there is no business of the state levying due harm on the people it is called upon to serve. Bear witness to the good nature of everyday Americans, who just want people to live their everyday lives. Be the better person, or be swallowed by the maelstrom of evil that envelops all who think they can tame the jungle that is the eschatology of the 25 percenters. The choice, ultimately, is yours, Governor. Don't hurt kids. AlexSilver Spring, Maryland",129903,9/26/22  11:43am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129903

Professional School Counselor ,This policy is NOT in accordance with evidence based best practices,"Research is provided to show that the new policy is not aligned with the empirically founded evidence based best practices. 56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. A protective factor for transgender youth that mitigates this risk and reduces suicidal ideation and suicide attempts  is school belongingness (Austin et al., 2020).  28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020). Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked out or abused (Thoma, 2021). Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022). As a parent and school counselor in VA's public school system, I STRONGLY OPPOSE this policy. Transgender students exist, they always have, and they always will. These policies will only harm this already vulnerable population of youth. ",129939,9/26/22  11:51am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129939
Pat Fallon ,SUPPORT!  Parents are their child's best advocate.,"The idea that parents, by default, would be excluded from life altering decisions of their minor child's life flies in the face of all that is known about what makes a child healthy, happy and successful.  It is widely known, and frequently stated, that children with involved parents succeed both academically and psychologically over those children where parents are not involved.  That said, to paint all parents as unsupportive in this particular issue by default (guilty until proven innocent) is both destructive and dangerous to children.  Parents are the best and only long-term support mechanism for their children. If there is fear that a parent might be a danger to their child related to any issue, then the school district should report that parent to social services.  The school system is not qualified or trained to deal with this level of psychological issue. I support this model policy as it puts parents back in charge of raising THEIR children, not the school system.     ",129940,9/26/22  11:51am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129940

Anonymous ,Strongly Opposed: These policies do not yield a beneficial outcome for students,"The model policies do not represent my values as a parent of three school-age children in Virginia public schools. They are not backed by any credible research that demonstrates any public benefit. While many parents have opinions on this point, it is vital to apply expertise. Gender, like many other aspects of humanity, has been academically studied with rigor for many, many years. No gender research supports policies like these as a means of producing a beneficial outcome. Importantly, these model policies center the desires of parents, not the benefits to students. The only outcome of these policies is to make parents happier. They do not describe any actual harm prevented or benefit created for the students. When it is time to choose policies on mathematics (e.g., which topics to include at what age and how to teach them) we don't ask a representative set of parents for their opinions. We seek and use the recommendations of mathematicians and educators with verifiable credentials. Gender should be treated the same way: we should seek out professional researchers and experts with verifiable credentials and listen well to their counsel. This is not a situation where all individuals' opinions carry equal weight. Like math, science, sports, or history, there are experts whose opinions should carry more weight. These policies should not be subject to popular vote, nor should they be led by a minority of opinionated stakeholders. They should be driven by experts with demonstrable credentials in the field of education and gender and the department of education should be obligated to cite the source and credentials of the experts informing this policies.",129942,9/26/22  11:51am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129942
Charlotte Lehwald ,My story and trans experience may differ from your story or life.,"I will start by stating outright that there are certain things i do not agree with in my own community. I am a transgender female, 56 years old, have lived a full and rich life, raised a family, lost an oldest child, experienced a lot in a relatively short number of years. I grew up in a conservative ""Christian"" home, attended church weekly, billy graham revivals, Montreat,  attended Wheaton christian high school etc... I also at the age of 9 loathed my male genitalia to the point i would self mutilate. i would in secret put on my sisters clothes and makeup in the bathroom and then in a panic leave it all behind me. My mother spent many years trying to help me and find out why i was having so many difficulties in school and life but in the family i had there was NO disclosing what i was experiencing. I lived with a secret for decades that tormented, set me apart from my peers, kept me constant isolation and made me feel as though there was something seriously wrong with me. It was not until i was 35 when a business associate informed me that they would be taking a medical leave of absence and when they returned they would be known as Jessica, not John. That conversation was the first time i heard the word transgender. She was an executive vice president of software development for a company who's software i had been using for years. I had no idea you could be a professional in this American corporate world and make that kind of change. I went home that day and looked up the word ""Transgender"" and it was like the light came on for the first time in my life. The more i read, the more i researched the more i found myself in the words that were put before me. The feeling i had was utter relief and explained so so so much about what i had been experiencing since i was a child.  I had been in therapy, seen psychiatrist as a child who i ""kind of"" disclosed what i had been feeling but never before had i understood that there was an actual word for the experience i had been living with for so many years that entirely described my experience. That was where it started for me and i met with a psychiatrist who specialized for years in experiences such as mine. I decided i would transition and live my life in an entirely different way that i had lived in for years. She told me the best transition was the longest transition which were words that guided the rest of my journey.  I know who i am, i have a full understanding of my biology, i know that i am not biologically speaking a female but that has no bearing on how i chosen to live out the rest of my life. I medically transitioned in 2014 at the age of 48(i think) and i have not looked back since. Sadly, i will admit to still living with a degree of isolation but i have found that is due to our society and the stigma and misunderstanding that exists about what being transgender is and an almost unwillingness to learn and practice empathy. People's discomfort is often outwardly projected with a hostile response to my existence which i see and experience regularly. When i first began transitioning the most important thing to me was being able to ""pass"" as a female so i could just blend into society. Today, that is no longer important to me and the discomfort others feel in my presence sense is not my problem it is their problem. I am an attractive woman, with a rich soulfulness, a good heart, a generous and giving spirit and am. fun, sporty, a titch butch, with a still masculine voice. None of that matters however because I'm not living my life for you, i'm living my life for me. I have to live in my own skin and feel good about myself and that can't depend on your acceptance or capacity for empathy or understanding or kindness. That's much easier for me today at 56 but i can GUARANTEE YOU it is not that easy for younger people and children.  You have a choice to make, you can either support those who have far less experience with life and are far more vulnerable or you can be a boulder in their path and make their experience more difficult and uncomfortable than it already is. I can assure you having spoken with dozens if not hundreds of parents who have kids that are struggling with their gender whether they be non-binary, non gender-conforming, trans masculine or feminine their experience in i'll say most all cases is real, it is not to be dismissed, minimized, made fun of or mocked. I look to political figures as those who take on one of the greatest responsibilities and that is to be a PUBLIC SERVANT to all their constituents. Not just those they side with or visa versa. Our politicians today are failing miserably, we have forgotten how to have conversations and hold other responsible for being able to hold conversations that seek to find solutions that work for everyone. As a society we have become consumed with only what is good for me and forgotten about caring how others might feel, to have an understanding that not everyone shares the same experience or are living the same way.  I also do mean that in an overall sense, we're all guilty.  That said, in this case as a public servant of a state who has a responsibility to all the people of said state i would surely hope you are not a boulder in an already difficult path for a young child, of any age. I would hope that you can create an environment where you can drive difficult conversations for yourself and others that can be constructive and not destructive or made to create an environment of perpetual misunderstandings. I would hope that you can actually be a leader of a state where you take into account that people's experiences are different and not everyone fits into some cookie cutter pretty package and remember at all time that your position affords you a great opportunity to be a real public servant and actually serve all those who reside in your state and not just those you petition to obtain their votes.  Kids need support, all kids need support... even those who are having a white picket fence life where everything fits together nicely but for those whose lives are already not working out that way... they too need support and not and they definitely do not need others who old so tight to their own idealogical prejudices against themselves and even their parents. I assure you having lived this experience for 40+ years and both sides that it is not some pretend fairytale lie these kids are telling, it is real and you stand to make a positive or negative difference in their lives and unless you are the type of person who just doesn’t give a sh-t about anyone other than yourself than work to be a positive influence and work to find solutions not just slam the door shut because that’s what “your” voters want you to do.",129943,9/26/22  11:51am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129943
Aaron ,Opposed - let's keep moving forward...,"Reading some of the comments in this space leaves me with a few burning questions: 1) What is lost or risked when transgender students are allowed access to resources and spaces in a way that matches who they are?  At the school where I work, the obvious answer of our community's experience is: NOTHING.  We were quite worried before we had our first openly transgender student but, honestly, it has been a completely seamless ""change.""  And we're a boarding school...  I think we adults need to recognize that today's youth live in a world where identity and choice are and should be up to the individual.  The judgment of society does not exist in the same way that it did even 10 years ago.  We should not take them backward or use our outdated concerns to shape the future... 2) How can we justify making changes that we know will negatively impact mental health?  All of the research shows that transgender youth are at much higher risk of mental health issues, abuse, and other endangering situations.  The more we normalize transgender youth, the less likely these issues are to continue.  The more we point fingers and force people into situations where they don't feel comfortable, the more issues will continue to arise.  Let's be kind!!

LJH ,"Strongly, vehemently oppose","I strongly, strongly oppose the 2022 proposed model policy. According to the Trevor Project's 2022 national survey on LGBTQ youth mental health found that 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide last year, and more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth. More than 1.8 million LBTQ youth seriously consider suicide each year in the US, and at least 1 attempts suicide every 45 seconds. Another recent study found that Transgender teens are 7.6x more likely to attempt suicide than their peers (university of ottowa study, 2022). Suicide is the 4th leading cause of death for adolescents from age 15 to 19. Trans and Nonbinary youth are vulnerable, and it's our job to support them - not to shame them, bully them, or force them into boxes. This policy is cruel, and will result in irreparable harm for trans and nonbinary kids and their families, including loss of life. Please don't do this to our trans and nonbinary kids.

Allison ,Strongly Oppose,"This policy needlessly puts professional and judgment-minded counselors and teachers between students and parents when students are navigating their own identities. It’s fairly simple; a household with parents who desire a strong relationship with their children and involvement in their childrens’ lives on these highly sensitive issues already have the knowledge they need from their son or daughter to navigate these unique and delicate decisions. The parents who would require a school to call them and inform them of the information their son or daughter shared with a counselor or teacher do not offer an emotionally safe environment at best, and a physically safe environment at worse. The consequence of these needless and over-bearing rules will harm people under the age of 18, and will not improve anyone’s lives. I am beyond frustrated that this administration continues to insert itself into the personal lives of Virginians. Schools are not pushing agendas around trans issues, they are simple teaching tolerance and acceptance to students at large, which means an adolescent who is being bullied at school or just desires to be themselves can not seek the help of their guidance counselor who will be required to tattle on them. It is well documented that gay, queer, and trans students have a higher suicide rate than any other adolescent group. Trans adolescents are less than a percent of the population, and so for the amount of time and resources this administration has wasted on their insistence that this is somehow a “problem” is absolutely ludicrous. Enough is enough.

Everyone that is for this policy should, if they call themselves Christian, drop that title. Because this is not Christlike behavior in any manner. Also, all you are really doing is keeping parents from understanding their children.

Taryn ,You should be ashamed of yourself,"Dear Governor,  I would say you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself but I know you have no shame so I wouldn't expect you to show a shred of decency or empathy to anyone that is different from you. Your proposed policies will have gut-wrenching consequences on young trans kids and students in VA and around the country. You are using innocent lives as a wedge issue to drum up support with your base and create a problem where there is none. Trans and nonbinary kids and students deserve to be supported and allowed to be the fullest version of themselves in school and everywhere else. No one is harmed by allowing them to do so. Schools are supposed to be a safe haven where young people learn and grow and become who they are meant to be. The rates of self-harm and suicide are incredibly high amongst LGBTQ+ youth. This issue is deeply personal to me. I lost my partner to suicide a few years ago at just 25 years old because of bullies like you who use religion to harm, ostracize and demonize people who are just trying to be themselves. We are not a theocracy. Our constitution specifically calls for the separation of church and state. To impose the hateful religious beliefs of a small minded, backwards and vocal minority on students in Virginia is antithetical to what this country was founded on. Interesting that you can abandon your constitutional conservativism when it serves you personally. When fear mongering and scapegoating an entire group of people to appeal to hateful MAGA republicans. You are a coward and the harm that comes from this will be on your hands.  If there is any issue to address, it should be the harassment and bullying of LGBTQ+, especially trans/non-binary kids, in schools. Look at any piece of research and you would clearly see that the group you are targeting is already disproportionally affected by violence and harassment. You are contributing and exacerbating that with these policies. Your pathetic attempts to harm kids who are just trying to live their lives is despicable and it is not reflective of what Virginia values can and should be. You should be working to make sure the Commonwealth is as safe as it can be for every individual, no matter how they might identify.  Recent federal court decisions have upheld protections for transgender people, including a 2020 U.S. Supreme Court decision, written by Trump appointee Neil M. Gorsuch, that determined that civil rights law barring sex discrimination covers transgender people. What you're doing will not stand and it is clearly a political stunt to bolster support from your most hateful, small-minded, and uneducated supporters. You will not win this fight because trans folks and the LGBTQ+ community more broadly are some of the most beautiful, resilient and powerful people in the universe and collectively we will make sure you do not succeed. ",,9/26/22  11:57am,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=129975

While there may be some that truly do feel this way (and good for them), the majority are attention seeking. So many see that this is a special interest group getting attention and to many that is extremely attractive (akin to getting ""likes"" on Facebook or instagram).  These ridiculous policies (by Northum) create undue work for teachers who should focus only on teaching. You can be kind to a kid who identifies as something other than their birth sex without having policy; let that be the social-emotional learning. So many people quote statistics (the same GLSEN study) that states without some policy that 50% of people who claim to be transgender or non-binary will commit suicide...but do you think a policy like this will prevent that? Of course if we cater to that group, raise them up and continually ""celebrate"" their mere existence, I'm sure some will feel fabulous and turn away from that horrific act. But some, by the sheer fact that they have gender dysphoria may not and that is horrible. But making everyone in the world cater to a small few people  by compelling speech of others, changing the landscape of competitive sports, etc is asinine. This statistic is like comparing the suicidal rate in those taking antidepressant....these people are depressed and have lots of heavy stuff going on..of course they that rate will be higher in that group. same with folks with gender dysphoria.

Doing this now will ensure the midterms are heavily slanted towards liberals and progressives, and ensure you won't be able to do a single thing the remainder of your time in office, as well as ensure your loss in the next election.

"Lisa C., mother of a trans public school student in VA ","This is a cruel, discriminatory, deadly policy, and I vehemently oppose it","As the mother of a transgender teenage daughter, I see how policies like this affect trans kids every day. My daughter has two supportive parents at home, but not all LGBTQ+ kids are that lucky. A policy that ""outs"" kids to their unaffirming and unaccepting parents will have deadly consequences. For some kids, school is their only safe place. This policy would get rid of that safety. You cannot call yourself pro-life and support such a dangerous policy. Using a student's preferred name and pronouns harms no one. You don't have to understand or even ""agree with"" a student's identity to call them by their preferred name and pronouns, and nobody else's religious or other rights are infringed by requiring that they address a student by their preferred name and pronouns. If trans students' names aren't respected, why stop there? Nobody should be allowed to be called a name that differs from their full legal name on their birth certificate.  No Mike or Katie - only Michael and Katherine. If this sounds absurd, that's because it is absurd. Just call students by their preferred names. It's not that difficult. As far as bathrooms and locker rooms, there are zero documented cases of a student faking being transgender for the sake of accessing the opposite gendered bathroom or locker room in order to assault someone. Using the excuse that boys will say they identify as girls to attack girls in the restroom is baseless and presumptuous. Being transgender is not correlated in any way with being a sexual predator. Parents and education professionals/officials making wild accusations like this have caused my daughter such anxiety about using the restroom - ANY restroom - at school that she has developed an eating disorder. She is so afraid of being confronted and accused of something she would never do that she will just go all day without eating or drinking anything in hopes that she doesn't need to use the bathroom at school. People who support this policy bullied my child into an eating disorder. What it all boils down to is this: trans kids already deal with enough ridicule, hate, unfounded accusations, and anxiety over their every move being scrutinized by those who ""disagree with their lifestyle."" This policy only compounds all of these things. It wouldn't protect anyone or give all parents authority over their children's education. It's cruelty just for the sake of being cruel.

Anonymous ,Strongly Oppose!,"Gender identity is not an ideology. Allowing kids to explore their identity and become true to who they are is such an essential part of life. If we deny the ability to explore ourselves, we deny the ability to live our lives authentically and to their fullest. Denying the option and forcing these BS policies under the name of ""Christianity"" and religious politics is absurd. Forcibly outing children to their families significantly increases the chances of suicide or self-harm and brings in a whole new dynamic of their families not accepting them for who they truly are; this brings on more abuse and, in some cases, a very unsafe living situation. Not to mention the number of children forced to become homeless because they were kicked out after their parents were informed that they were trans and want to live as authentically as anyone else. I have never felt anything but welcomed and safe in the LGBTQIA+ communities; I have several friends and family members in the LGBTQIA+ community. Seeing them live authentically brings a massive smile to everybody's faces and makes the world more welcoming. ",130016,9/26/22  12:05pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130016

The name a person chooses to use is a vital shorthand for expressing who they are and who they want to be. Not allowing young people to make this decision for themselves is dehumanizing. Additionally, this policy is not well thought out, as it also technically forbids obvious nicknames without explicit parental consent (""I prefer to be called Steph, not Stephanie""), which is a stance I cannot imagine a single person supports. This policy is hurtful not only to trans students but also to anyone who feels uncomfortable with their assigned name and wishes to be called something else (see all the people who have recently been uncomfortable with the name of ""Karen"").

Anonymous ,Strongly Oppose,"Let’s start by noting that historically, trans youth have had an exponentially higher rate of suicide. One thing that psychologists have noticed is that there’s less gender dysphoria when trans people feel supported and protected. That means that the suicide rate goes down for the most vulnerable segment of the population when they are made to feel like part of the population.  Now, let’s think about numbers. There have been exactly zero cases of children sexually assaulting other children in restrooms solely by claiming trans status. There was one case of a potential romantic partner pressure situation (not sure if it was charged as an assault), which could happen with any same-gender couple, just as it does for mixed-gender couples. And that has nothing to do with the person’s gender identity. So the DOE’s prior change in position supporting trans youth did nothing harmful, and helped create safer spaces for trans youth.  Now, the administration wants to use trans youth as a punching bag to rally a base that is out-of-touch with current medical and psychological recommendations. This is abhorrent. The DOE should not use a vulnerable class to try to make political gains for the governor. This is not political theater; actual lives are on the line - and not just by suicide. Youth being raised in bigoted households will see this and think it’s okay to bully trans people, who already have one of the highest rates for victimization when it comes to assault and murder, with trans people of color being at the greatest risk. By allowing the governor to go through with this, it will put trans youth at risk for violence of all types.   I urge you to scrap this proposed policy.   a Virginia voter",130029,9/26/22  12:06pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130029

Sam Winsor ,Connecting some simple dots ,"We’re not gonna pretend like there aren’t abusive parents in the state of Virginia—let’s start there first. You really think if some of these parents find out about a child’s identity that their rage is somehow going to just be channeled into some wholesome discourse with their children about how they identify at school in a safer environment than at home? Do the math, why do you think kids would hide this information from parents????? The state of Virginia can see why kids hide who they are from family at home but you wanna keep a record and report on these babies for just trying to figure out they’re human? Think about how much being trans and a child in America is hotly debated right now, think about the fact that many of these kids aren’t even safe at home to begin with. Not everyone is blessed with loving, forgiving, compassionate parents who will work with their kid through anything. Y’all know damn well that’s not been everyone’s blessing. So you wanna put children, literal kids, in a position where any parent who could harm them is made aware of who they are in a safer environment like at school? Google the rates of homelessness in LGBTQ teens.  when my father found out about me I was locked in my room for days. Beaten. It didn’t take the transness out of me but it almost killed me. And it only got worse.  spend this time trying to build compassionate communities who don’t judge or react in violence or exclusion because someone else is experiencing a different life.

Doris W. Gelbman ,OPPOSE WITHDRAWAL of Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public,"Totally OPPOSE the withdrawal of the 2021 Model guidelines for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia Public Schools as it VIOLATE the Virginia Values Act, which itself amends the Virginia Human Rights act to include specifically enacted PROTECTIONS for all Virginians - students, parents and teachers alike, from discriminatory actions based on sex, sexual orientation or gender identity. There is nothing in the 2021 guidelines that precludes parents' involvement in their child's education, progress, participation. Parents are of course free to openly discuss their child's thoughts and feelings on all issues related to sex, sexual orientation and gender identity according to their beliefs, mores and cultural identity.  But school policy should NOT be used to violate a student - or teacher or other staff member - to treat ANY student (a ""person"")  differently based on their identity.  The Code of Virginia currently states: It is an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person, including the owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, agent, or employee of any place of public accommodation, to refuse, withhold from, or deny any individual, or to attempt to refuse, withhold from, or deny any individual, directly or indirectly, any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, services, or privileges made available in any place of public accommodation, or to segregate or discriminate against any such person in the use thereof, or to publish, circulate, issue, display, post, or mail, either directly or indirectly, any communication, notice, or advertisement to the effect that any of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, privileges, or services of any such place shall be refused, withheld from, or denied to any individual on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, disability, or status as a veteran.  The 2021 policy supports the provisions of the Virginia Antidiscrimination law. To withdraw that support and propose contrary guidance for the treatment of Transgender (or other sexual minorities) in the public school system is UNLAWFUL. Parents are FREE and I support the wish for them to engage with and to discuss with their children anything they wish - included such things related to sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other subject of concern to them with relation to their children. It is PARENTS job to provide a safe and unthreatening channel of of communication with their own children.  If parents' do not wish to participate in the free and open, supportive environment in public schools based on their own individual set of beliefs, religious, moral or otherwise, they are free to educate their children at home, or in private schools.  PUBLIC accomodation is mandated to be free of any form of discrimination.",130041,9/26/22  12:09pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130041

Nathan Brown ,Protect Trans Students,"I strongly oppose the Governor's anti-trans policy for Virginia Department of Education. This plan, if enacted, would result in further alienation of trans students in our schools, resulting in a significant impact to their ability to feel comfortable in their educational environment. This will have a negative impact on their abilities for academic success, social development, and impact their general livelihoods. Students spend a significant amount of their lives in school, and to be placed in an environment where the Governor has mandated a hostile environment against them can only do harm, and not any good, and in extreme cases, can result in suicide in a population that is already at higher risks for suicide. While we may have different opinions about human sexuality, it should never be viewed by anyone as acceptable for students to be ""outed"" against their will to their parents. These proposed regulations would do just that, potentially expanding the harm for LGBTQ+ students not only to their school environment, but also their home environment. In serious cases, this may even result in the student being made homeless by their families, and youth LGBTQ+ homelessness is well documented. Forcing trans students to use bathrooms that do not correspond with their true gender identity makes these students targets for bullying, abuse, and violence.   These regulations also clearly violate the Virginia Values Act and are therefore unlawful. If the Governor wishes to pursue this harmful policy, he must go through the Legislature to change the law. This is, quite simply, unlawful executive overreach by the part of the Governor. I respect that many different people of goodwill can have differing opinions on LGBTQ+ rights in our schools, but we should ALL be able to agree that what should unite us is a desire to help all of our students and create good environments for them to learn. We can not do that if we make LGBTQ+ students out to be ""the enemy"" in pursuit of a culture-war agenda.  I hope the Governor will reconsider this short-sighted policy, and when he does not, I know our Courts will do the right thing and strike down these unlawful regulations that will harm our kids and students.

Anonymous ,STRONGLY OPPOSED to Younkin’s Anti-Trans Youth Proposal ,"Even with the most supportive of parents, figuring out you’re trans is absolutely terrifying, and it’s something that can’t be rushed. Teens need the ability to go about discovering themsleves, and coming to understand their own gender, at a pace that allows them to feel safe; this includes giving them the control over who knows what they’re struggling with (and who knows they’re trans). Beyond this, creating an environment where students cannot confide in school counselors the things they can’t get trust their parents with will cause them to turn in on themselves; as it is, trans youth have extremely high rates of depression and suicide, largely in part because they cannot safely be themselves.  furthermore, not every parent is accepting. The response ranges, generallly, from “polite but confused acceptance” to “you’re here, but we don’t accept you and will make your life a living hell every time you don’t conform to what we want” to “I will kick you out of the house for existing as a trans person.” Depending on which type of parents the child has to report to, mandatory reporting of gender identity to said parents could actually result in an extremely depressed child— and that’s the better case scenario. The worst is homelessness, homicide (trans people, especially trans women, are massive hate crime targets) and/or suicidality. Younkin is not trans. He will never understand what it is like to feel disconnected from yourself; to know that in order to be who you are, you have risk your life and your livelihood. This risk doesn’t end upon leaving public school, but it can be mitigated if we just give our trans youth the right to self-determination when it comes to what their parents do or don’t know. Because parents aren’t some distant connection to meet up with on holidays, to the underaged: they’re landlords, they’re lawmakers, they’re in complete and utter control of every aspect of your life to the point where gaining your own freedom— and your own legal autonomy-/  before eighteen has to be won in a /court case/ (emancipation) if you’re willing to strive for it at all. There is no escaping them when you share your house with them, and are dependent on them in every sense of the term. Maybe Youngkin has forgotten that, as old as he is, but that is what it is for these children— for all children, even in the best of circumstances.  Let them still have this one freedom.

Do we think those same business leaders will want to move or expand their headquarters here knowing their employees' children won't be safe from state-sanctioned discrimination? I already recognize the administration of this governor does not respect the will of the majority of voters or the danger this demagoguery risks, but hopefully at least this administration will care about the economic hazards a choice like this brings to our state.",130056,9/26/22  12:11pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130056

Many families, while good-intentioned, do not make the best decisions for their child at first glance and in turn create more harm, thus making our new generation a lot more fragile and/or rough around the edges to new things like learning. We owe it to them to be open and accepting to listen to them. Parents are very much allowed to have a say however they should not be the ones controlling the schools, and thus if they do not like what the school is doing, they have the right to move schools. The Parents should not hold such power over a place where many children view it as a safe haven and a place to learn and be accepted by their peers as they grow into themselves.

Morgan ,Protect Trans Kids. Do not do this. ,"Adding this additional layer of requirement to have a trans kids pronouns and any name change requests honored by teachers will not keep them any safer or healthier. Trans kids are not always growing up in a safe, supportive home. They need to be given the space to safely express their gender. Asking to use a different name harms no one. Asking for something as minimal as saying ""She"" instead of ""He"" harms no one. Notifying a parent who does not support their child's wishes harms that child. We need to have places children can feel safe when their home is not one of those places. They need refuge. They need social support. Forcing all requests to come from a parent isolates that child. They will wither. We need to allow children a degree of autonomy and the space to develop a sense of self determination. Children are not empty robots to be piloted by their parents until they are an adult. They are thinking, feeling people. And they may hold values and beliefs counter to their parents. That does NOT make them harmful. That does NOT make them a concern a parent must be notified about.

If you have a student who wishes to be called by their middle name rather than their legal first name, do you require parental approval for that? Put differently - what is your actual issue here? To deny a child their lived identity (or to require a parent/guardian's permission for a child to be themselves) is cruelty for the sake of cruelty. It protects no one and instead harms a very specific portion of the population.

julie ,School Enables Children to Grow Into Adults,Most adults have antedotes on how a teacher or other faculty member made a difference in their lives by allowing them space to develop and grow into the person they are. Taking away teachers ability to use discretion and adjust their methods will result in loss of this mentorship opportunity for one of the most vulnerable groups at this age. Giving students a safe place to learn free from bias and threat of outing will improve the chances that young people reach adulthood (see LGBT suicide rates) as well as grow into successful adults.

Some parents would do harm to their kids if they were forcibly outed, enough that it is not with passing a policy like this. If parents on the right are truly concerned they can talk to their children, instead of forcing teachers into the role of spy and nanny. it’s also telling that, even when there is documentation in place, Gov Youngkin would include a section about not addressing the student by their proffered name/pronoun if it “infringes in your 1st amendment rights”; why would there be this section if the point of this is just parental rights like the VA GOP claims?

Health Professional & Parent ,"Support the undoing of harmful practices, especially for our daughters/girls","This is yet another case that is mind boggling as to why anyone even needs to reverse a nonsensical policy to begin with. I see all of these ""opposed"" remarks, yet, once more, like so much of the media, the screaming of a few doesn't represent the thoughts and values of the majority, hence why Youngkin got elected in the first place. Political agendas and societal brainwashing do not belong at school. While I am in support of people being who they truly believe they are and am certainly opposed to hateful acts from one group to the next, it should not trump or impede on the rights of parents and other children. Furthermore, this disturbing ""trend"" is adding confusion to kids who would not otherwise be confused. Research has suggested the brain is not fully developed until one's early 20s. Trans and especially ""trans kids"" are such an incredibly minuscule part of society, yet one would think, due to the noise of activists and other misguided individuals that this is commonplace. Adolescence is in itself almost a time of confusion, a time to naturally try on different hats if you will. This commonly means that the adolescent may switch tastes in clothes, want to be a rock star one day, then a few weeks later, a hippie and so on. Those changes or trying on of identities is perfectly normal during this stage of development. For the majority of kids and for the majority of time/history, this confusion has rarely ever meant they were confused on their true sex or gender. It is preposterous and damaging to subject children to this during a very fragile state in their development.  Even though trans and certainly this notion of ""trans kids"" are an extremely small part of the population, my only qualm about the new policies is that for those who truly and consistently over time believe they were born in the wrong skin, certain parents may not feel like a child's ""safe place"" to express their feelings, in which case I support them having another trusted adult, such as a counselor to confide in. All kids deserve a person they can share their deepest feelings and thoughts with. My support is mainly for the return of sanity and normalcy--for school to be a place that focuses on academics and promotes healthy social and psychological supports. This disturbing effort to desensitize children and/or the seemingly sexualization of children is incredibly scary and disturbing with respect to both physical and psychological safety. I'm not just talking about trans issues, but this overall sick push to normalize explicit and pornographic materials puts all of our children in jeopardy.  I absolutely am vehemently opposed to biological boys being in girl's bathrooms, locker rooms or sports, nor should bio females be in boys' spaces. Having a single bathroom available for anyone to use seems reasonable. I also definitely don't support this pronoun nonsense no one really heard of until the past couple of years. I think Youngkin is trying to support common sense, righting wrongs of the extreme, and protecting parents' rights, but mostly children, especially our girls and daughters. Women have fought so hard for rights and to feel safe and respected. It is sad to see that take a step back lately. No one with a penis (short of a hermaphrodite) has any good idea of what it is like to be a woman physically, mentally, societally, and certainly should never be called, ""mom."" All kids and families have suffered so much by far-left policies and decision making from being kept from school to extreme political agendas. Pushing agendas on vulnerable children must stop! School should feel safe for all kids, but it is important to understand how all sides of this notion or idealism could create conflict for different sets of children. No one group will be completely happy. Supports for all should be in place without completely infringing on the rights of others. A guidance counselor stipulation where no names etc. are being changed might be ideal for ANY kids who may not have open and understanding parents whether this issue be one's sexuality, potential abuse, peer pressure, bullying, disability discrimination, racism etc. For any parents who disagree with that, there are guidance opt out forms. I also fully support, especially during adolescence where kids are leaning on peers more than parents at times, middle and high schools have trained peer support specialists where kids can talk to a supportive, non- judgmental peer. ",130165,9/26/22  12:27pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130165

Andrew Barnick ,Strongly oppose this performative cruelty,"I shouldn't have to explain why this policy is cruel. Transgender students are and have always been free to come out to their parents personally, and many do—excluding those who have reason to suspect that their parents will not be loving and supportive. Mandating that schools disrespect and disregard students' chosen identities and even out those students to their parents (despite the very real possibility that those parents might react with abuse) is sick, and twisted, and serves no public interest. But of course, the cruelty is by design. Governor Youngkin has chosen to sacrifice this tiny minority with no electoral power as red meat for his base. He is so dogmatically opposed to transgender identity that he has chosen to target children (who did not and could not vote for him)—and not just any children, but a vulnerable and oppressed minority of children. I only hope that Virginians recognize this cruelty for what it is and reject this government-sponsored persecution.",130172,9/26/22  12:28pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130172
Kala Melchiori ,Strongly Oppose - violation of human rights,"Children have basic human rights. Among those are to be treated with humanity and dignity, including when they are at school. The state has little opportunity to ensure these rights are being met within the home, but ample opportunity to ensure these rights are being met at school. Therefore schools should honor children's preferred names and pronouns while at school. Refusing to do so threatens the well-being of transgender and nonbinary students. ",130173,9/26/22  12:28pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130173
Cecilia Spain ,"If we're worried about safety, why are we putting LGBTQ+ kids at risk?","If Glenn Youngkin is concerned about the safety of students, then mental health crises should be of greater concern. Treating transgender kids with respect and calling them by their chosen names harms no one. However, refusing to do so only seeks to further harm trans and non-binary kids. It creates a hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for those same students as they require teachers and staff to “forcibly out” students to their parents against the student’s will, even in cases where students seek counseling for abusive at home environments. Mental health of students is a serious issue that is not focused on enough in our schools. LGBTQ+ children are higher risk of mental health crises. Youngkin's policy is putting trans students further into harm's way, it also forces the students into a bathroom and sports policy that do not adhere to their true gender identity, making them potential targets for bullying, abuse, and violence. In 2021, Governor Ralph Northam signed the Virginia Values Act into law after it was passed through the General Assembly. This law sweepingly, effectively prohibited discrimination in public and private employment, credit, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among other additional protected categories. The protections in this act have been extended to protect LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia public schools throughout the Commonwealth to prohibit discrimination, harassment, and violence in against these students. I have observed first hand the positive effects of this act.  If Glenn Youngkin is worried about privacy, dignity, and respect, then respect LGBTQ+ children and maintain their privacy (outing them to family is not respecting privacy).   ",130174,9/26/22  12:28pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130174

They can always raise a complaint if their are issues, but I suspect that will be rare unless a teacher is openly hostile to a child's wishes.   Additionally, denying children this small level of agency in their lives seems cruel.

Are we not all entitled to the pursuit of happiness? I've lived in Virginia all my life, and plan to stay here for the rest of it, and it saddens me to see our beautiful state with so much potential wasting efforts on such an insignificant issue. Trans kids will still go on to pay taxes, have jobs, raise families, vote, and generally contribute to our society, regardless of gender identity. Why would we want them to hate Virginia? I believe we should be spending our resources on things that actually matter to GOVERNMENT. Libraries, schools, policies that benefit Virginia. Instead Youngkin wants to spend his time as Governor pushing his own beliefs onto children and families he doesn't know or understand the dynamic of. There is no benefit of doing this aside from harming trans people. And even if you don't like trans people, which in itself is incredibly reductive of a diverse group of human beings, how does making them hate Virginia and it's government benefit anybody?

Anonymous ,Educator who is strongly opposed to this policy ,"I work in education in Virginia and have for the last 13 years.  In that time, I have had several transgender students in my classroom.  Some have even come to speak to me about coming out as trans during their time in my classroom.   Research shows us that it is monumentally important for us to create classrooms where students feel included.  When they feel included, they feel safe and can learn to the best of their ability.  Part of creating a safe environment for them includes using a preferred name and the correct pronouns for that student.   Parents do not always know what is best for their child.  I have had a few students whose parents did not accept who they were when they were living at home.  I've seen 18-year-old student sob in my office when they tell me they are gay and have always known but couldn't say anything.  I have also had trans students tell me their childhood was miserable because they were discouraged from expressing their identity. My question is this--what does it hurt to allow trans students to be who they are?  Is it a huge inconvenience to call a student by a preferred name?  Don’t we already use nicknames?  Is it a disruption to change pronouns or avoid using them with a student who doesn’t feel like they identify as one specific gender? Who does it hurt if a transgender student uses the bathroom that they identify with?  The answer is that it doesn’t hurt educators or other students at all.  But it will hurt a transgender student if we refuse to support them and their identity. How many kids will needlessly suffer because of this policy?  I am tired of hearing out of date teachers make statements like, “Well, what if the student says they identify as a tree today?  Do I have to call them a tree?” They do not get it.  It is not about students trying to “abuse” the system or agreeing or disagreeing with someone’s sexual and gender identity.  It’s about supporting kids when they really need that support.  It’s about creating a learning environment where all students feel included and valued for who they are.  I don’t understand why we think we need to have a policy that states that parents are the decision makers about gender when it is clearly a personal, intrinsic decision.  Parents may not understand their children—especially if they have never considered what it means to be LGBTQIA+ or what the experience is like for children who know they aren’t in the right body. Let’s focus on what matters—not target a small vulnerable population of students who are already at risk for mental health issues. ",130217,9/26/22  12:35pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130217

I watched as he created a fake narrative of “critical race theory” being taught in Virginia schools and egged on racist parents to “report” their school districts and teachers. And now I watch as he has turned his eye towards, like the rest of his fascist gubernatorial neighbors, towards us. Transgender youth in Virginia. Youngkin’s plan forces transgender children to be outed by schools to their parents, who may be abusive and extremely transphobic. Youngkin’s plan also forces schools to deadname and misgender children, which will crush their spirits even more than they already have been by the pressure of being transgender in America. Enough of this, Glenn Youngkin.

"Dr. Sabrina Dent, Center for Faith, Justice, and Reconciliation ",WE OPPOSE. CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM HAS NO PLACE IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS!,"Dear Governor Youngkin and VA Department of Education administration,   As a person of faith, parent of a school-aged child, adjunct professor, religious freedom and interfaith advocate, I am deeply disturbed by your proposed 2022 model policies and OPPOSE them. Whereas, you suggest that Virginia parents have the right to make decisions about our children; these policies actually prioritize the ideologies, rights, and concerns of a particular group of parents. This will cause great division in the Commonwealth in ways that your administration has not considered. Quite candidly, these policies violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the US Constitution because they show favor towards one religious group over another. That’s a form of Christian Nationalism, Governor. Religion should never be used as weapon to cause harm. Furthermore, it does not take into consideration employees of Virginia public schools who may support LGBTQ youth or even have a transgender child. This puts them in a very awkward position as an educator and provider of their household. If you are working on behalf of all Virginia families and students, your policies should be neutral and not show preference towards one set of religious beliefs over another. Nor should these policies present a threat towards transgender students in spaces where they should be welcomed and protected regardless of their religious, sexual, gender, racial, and any other identities.  Hear directly from one Virginia transgender student:   “As a transgender student who endured the American public school system, I carry my share of traumatic experiences that make this a very tangible concern for me. Our identities are not an “ideology”, they’re simply who we are. Putting us in harm’s way over a perceived difference in “belief” is a disgusting and dehumanizing overreach of governmental authority as well as a violation of adolescent human dignity contrary to the alleged (but unsupported by the body of the Model Policies) interests of the Act. If nothing else, it is a statistically sound means of raising the transgender suicide and at-home abuse rates. …Transgender human beings, especially not minors, do not deserve to be told through legislative code that they are better off dead or hurting.” Governor Youngkin, the Trevor Project estimates that more than 1.8 million LGBTQ youth (13-24) seriously consider suicide each year in the U.S. — and at least one attempts suicide every 45 seconds. Last week, I spoke with the parent of a transgender teenage girl who expressed concerns about potential increase in suicides as a result of this public policy that opens the flood gates of discrimination, bigotry, and hostility in public schools. This breaks my heart. As a parent and person of faith, I implore you to reconsider these emotionally, mentally, and spiritually damaging policies to show compassion for the most vulnerable: our students. For the love of human dignity and inclusion, Dr. Sabrina Dent CFJRpresident@faithandjusticerva.com",,9/26/22  12:36pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130220

Anonymous ,This would put many students in danger ,"Regardless of how someone sees themselves, people should be treated with respect. If someone didn't call you by your name, you'd rightfully be disrespected. Why is it that the state gets to tell people what they're called instead of themselves? This is a blatant attack against civil liberties, as people are their own beings. No state or authority should be able to enforce an identity, especially when someone specifically asks to not go by that. Playing on peoples' prejudices is the same justification given to not desegregate schools, both of which are gross government oversteps that enforced the horrible treatment of others. This country is founded on the idea of giving everyone an equal chance to then have them act how they see fit, and enforcing discrimination takes away from that central idea. I would urge everyone regardless of political party (I'm a Republican) to oppose this as it takes away from what makes America great, the true land of the free!",130228,9/26/22  12:37pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130228

How do we have the right to say, “I’m sorry but I refuse to recognize how you identify and who you are?” The fact of the matter is that what’s wrong with this picture is the adults who refuse to think outside of the narrow-minded views they have, NOT the children.

I am a nurse and I am beyond concerned about the increase in mental health-related admissions and suicide attempts amongst trans youth.

It makes no difference which restroom a student uses.

If a student who was deemed male at birth uses the female restrooms, they will be going into a stall because that is all there are in female restrooms. Either way, the students using the restroom that don't correspond with their gender at birth will be IN A STALL with a door closed. So, what's the problem? Was this policy set forth JUST to make a political statement? It would appear so since the ""reasons"" they give are totally irrelevant. Either way, it is a kid, using a restroom with a door closed.

Chris Berg ,Strongly oppose,"My child is nonbinary - and this policy was written specifically to remove any references of gender from schools.  Any school system that adopts this policy will not allow any teacher to acknowledge students who do not identify as male or female.  This is in direct opposition to the Virginia Human Rights act that prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity - and the law includes educational institutions.  Prohibiting a school from recognizing a nonbinary child as who they are is discrimination. It cites studies that highlight the importance of family involvement in children's lives - but ignores the fact that 2 out of 3 families aren't supportive of transgender children.  It ignores the fact that lack of family support - and support at school is exactly what drives these children to consider taking their own lives.  If anything - the studies that you've cited in this document support the fact that families need to be more accepting of these students. Despite the stated objectives -  If this policy was really about Parental Rights - I would be able to request that the school address my child as they/them - instead of just male or female If this policy was really about Parental Rights - we wouldn’t be required to provide legal documents just to have our children addressed by their chosen name at school If this policy was really about Freedom of Speech - supportive teachers wouldn’t be forced to ignore a student’s chosen name, or their gender just because of what their birth certificate says If this policy was really about Freedom of Religion - it wouldn’t ignore those whose religion call on them to treat others with compassion instead of disrespect If this policy was really about All Students - it wouldn’t exclude the most vulnerable students If this policy was really about Preventing Bullying - it wouldn’t devote almost every legal argument to legitimizing unsupportive parents and bigotry If this policy was really about The Truth - they wouldn’t need to redefine words to bend their meaning  ",130257,9/26/22  12:41pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130257

"Nancy D Hall, EdD, 4 Public Education (4PE) ",STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS CRUELTY TO TRANS YOUTH,"The level of cynicism we have come to expect from Glenn Youngkin and his party is on full display with this Model Policies proposal. It is not for him and his Cabinet of Cronies to decide if a child is safe coming out to their parents. The rapport and trust a student has in their teacher should be regarded as almost sacred, not as weaponized political pawns. These are our most vulnerable children, least able to protect themselves against bullying, which can lead to harm and suicidal ideation. These monsters should stop using fear to aggravate the families. Gender dysphoria has never been proven to be a cause of predatory behavior. This cabal should be ashamed or themselves for exposing our students to harm just because they can. Their thought process in no way represents the preponderance of the Commonwealth of Virginia citizens. We understand the ultimate goal: to arouse sufficient fear that discredits our fine public education system. Privatizing education has never helped families, it merely lines the pockets of the ""buy, gut, and sell"" privateers. Charter schools have a lifespan of about five years.  WE ALL KNOW THE END GOAL of this. Public education has historically been a soft constituency. We are organized, focused, and fearless.

"Sunny Furches, nonbinary educator and born and raised Virginian ","Strongly oppose, this policy is hypocritical. ","     I'm going to begin with a quote taken from the guidance document that was provided. ""All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying."" ALL students have the right to attend school free from discrimination. You can not say that all students have a right to attend school free from discrimination while actively trying to release a policy that discriminates against trans students. You think you're protecting the students, but really, you're harming them. For some students, it may be safe to get parental approval. But for some students, it's not safe to do so. So they are forced to be uncomfortable in their own skin both at home and in school, or put themselves in danger. I can say, at 22, I'm still not out to my parents in any regard, for this reason. I spent all of high school hiding who I was just so I could be safe, and that made me absolutely miserable. The only reason I'm not dead is because I cared too much about my friends. Now that I'm out of college and living on my own, I'm able to be myself, away from my family, and I am so much happier for it.      I hear the argument frequently of ""it's just a phase, they'll grow out of it"". So what if it's just a phase? Children should feel supported and encouraged, not stifled. When I was a kid I wanted to be a princess when I grew up. That was obviously a phase, yet nobody batted an eye or complained in the slightest. I think our priority should be making sure students feel safe and encouraged, and we can coddle the parents later. ",130276,9/26/22  12:42pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130276

Jennifer Cox ,Oppose,"These drafted policies would essentially force school counselors to out trans students to their parents before they are ready. As school counselors, we don't bring up conversations about gender with kids in individual counseling, but kids will often bring it up themselves. We have to talk to them in an affirming and safe environment. It is essential for LGBTQ+ youth to come out to their families themselves, when and if they feel safe to do so. The primary reason it is so important to affirm, protect, and create safe spaces at school for LGBTQ+ children is because LGBT adolescents are more likely than other kids their age to attempt suicide. Overall, sexual minority youth were 3.5 times as likely to attempt suicide as heterosexual peers. Transgender adolescents were 5.87 times more likely, gay and lesbian adolescents were 3.71 times more likely and bisexual youth were 3.69 times more likely than heterosexual peers to attempt suicide.

Anonymous ,Protect Trans Children,"The governor’s policies will cause the deaths of trans children. There is no mistaking it. When queer and and trans children are forbidden from being who they are, and are treated with state-sanctioned contempt and harm, they will die. This guidance is clearly meant to serve as a fascist dogwhistle to continue to oppress those that conservatives deem undesirable. The central framing of this guidance is also wrong; children are humans who are deserving of autonomy. This guidance places the right of parents to control their children over the rights of children to exist as individuals. The fact that “schools shall respect all children” is the LAST principle speaks volumes to what Gov Youngkin thinks the purpose of school is. Furthermore, how can we trust Gov Youngkin to have the interests of all children in the state of Virginia when his proposed policies regarding harassment in schools fail to provide safeguards against harassment and discrimination on the basis of sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression? When many students, both LGBTQ+ and not, face harassment in this way, and in some cases face harassment so extreme it causes withdrawing from school, moving, great physical and or emotional harm, or even death? The answer is that we cannot trust the governor, as he does not care. He has told us who he sees as human.

How is mandating a hostile schooling environment going to make anything better for anyone? ""The gender-affirming model of care affirms diversity in gender identity and assists individuals in defining, exploring, and actualizing their gender identity, allowing for exploration without judgments or assumptions. This does not mean that all youth need to undergo medical transition; indeed, this is often not the case. Gender-affirming care is highly individualized and focuses on the needs of each individual by including psychoeducation about gender and sexuality (appropriate to age and developmental level), parental and family support, social interventions, and gender-affirming medical interventions. It is well documented that TGNB adolescents and young adults experience anxiety and depression, as well as suicidal ideation, at a much higher rate than their cisgender peers. According to The Trevor Project’s 2020 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health, 54 percent of young people who identified as transgender or nonbinary reported having seriously considered suicide in the last year, and 29 percent have made an attempt to end their lives. In contrast, numerous research studies have found that gender-affirming care leads to improved mental health among TGNB youth."" https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/news/gender-affirming-care-saves-lives",,9/26/22  12:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130323

DeAnna Schuler ,Protect Trans Kids!,"This legislation is harmful and counterproductive. It completely discounts the mountain of existing evidence-based guidance put forth by experts in the fields of child psychology and behavior.  Rather than spending taxpayer dollars on genital- centric policies that strip children of their rights to privacy and the pursuit of happiness, focus on updating our public schools with gender-neutral facilities and programs. This way all students can go about their day without having to publicly announce their sex to gain entry.  Before this trans hysteria began, where I'm from, it's common for teachers to ask students if they have a nickname they would like to use in class. I don't recall that ever needing to be parent-approved. This should be no different. Refer to kids the way they would prefer. It harms no one but does a world of good for the kids. Please understand that ""outing"" a student to their parents over a name or a pronoun could lead directly to abuse, abandonment, or worse.  I'll also say that sex-segregated sports should be a thing of the past. I'd challenge anyone to look at the roster for any U8-U12 league and tell me the teams are ""fair"" to all players. I constantly hear outrage about trans kids having an advantage over their teammates, especially trans girls. Next time you're on the sports field, look at the height/weight differences among the players of those ages. Girls that are 4' 75lbs could easily be on the same team as girls 5'3"" 130lbs. However, because they're assigned female at birth, that's considered fair. You can't argue that trans girls are bigger/faster/stronger when statistically, girls assigned female at birth are all over the spectrum of weight and height too! Stop these harmful dehumanizing policies. Stop worrying about what's in our kids' pants and start working on legislation that will make everyone welcome and comfortable in their own skin.     ",130336,9/26/22  12:47pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130336

Anonymous ,Strongly opposed,"I am in favor of retaining the March 2021 model policies and not in favor of implementing the 2022 model policies at all. I was a transgender student in Virginia public schools in the early to mid-2000's. Bullying was rampant at the school where I attended and understanding of and compassion for transgender issues was virtually non-existent. As a student, I would have benefitted under the 2021 model policies and been actively harmed by the 2022 model policies.  It is striking that the title of the 2021 model policies includes the word transgender, but the 2022 model policies do not. That change is transphobic through distancing the policy from the very group the policy covers. The 2021 model also begins by defining terms related to gender identity which serves to ground the policy and demonstrates a knowledge of the issues. The 2022 policy by contrast, is bereft of any definitions for the terminology it uses.  I was sexually assaulted in school by a classmate who presumed I was gay. My parents were informed about the sexual assault by the principal of the school but not the reason why. My parents were homophobic and transphobic. If they had been informed about the reason at the time, I may have ended up being homeless. The greatest flaw that I see in the 2022 model policies is the belief that parents will be willing to partner with schools and that informing a parent about a child's gender identity or sexuality is always in the child's best interest. Some of us came from broken homes and had to be our own parents. I would go so far as to state that I might not have survived my own childhood had the 2022 model guidance been in place at the time.    ",130339,9/26/22  12:47pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130339

"Matt Royer, Virginia Young Democrats Executive Vice President ",The anti-trans model policies do not protect children. They only hurt them. ,"Trans students matter. Parents of trans students matter too. With this policy, you force them to endure bigotry and force their identities under the microscope to be picked apart by society and their peers. Where is the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect in that? These model policies are rooted in transphobia and only seek to further harm trans and non-binary kids. They create a hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for those same students as they require teachers and staff to “forcibly out” students to their parents against the student’s will, even in cases where students seek counseling for abusive at home environments.  By not allowing teachers to use students' gender affirming names and gender affirming pronouns, you subject them to mental anguish, torment, and bullying at the hands of their peers, and in some cases, downright violence. These students will undoubtedly be physically hurt by other students out of lack of understanding and intolerance, but unfortunately, statistics point to these students dying by suicide because of the toxic and unsafe environments that they are put into.  These policies claim to protect students from “forced social transitioning.” Ironically, these policies are what is forcing kids to accept genders that aren’t their own. None of this seems to emphasize ""privacy, respect, and dignity"" in Virginia Public Schools.  The harm to students and their families aside, these policies are pretty much illegal in the eye of state law and also go against legal precedent ruled on by the highest courts in the United States based on cases from right here in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Gavin Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board was ruled in favor of Gavin Grimm, not once but TWICE, which made a sweeping declaration that trans students should not be forced to use the bathrooms of the genders they were assigned at birth. These policies would go against the rulings of the nations' highest courts. In 2021, Governor Ralph Northam signed the Virginia Values Act into law after it was passed through the General Assembly. This law sweepingly, effectively prohibited discrimination in public and private employment, credit, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among other additional protected categories. The protections in this act have been extended to protect LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia public schools throughout the Commonwealth to prohibit discrimination, harassment, and violence in against these students.  This anti-trans campaign and policy has real life consequences for many people and it’s taken out on children who are trying to find their identity, like any kid should be able to do in their own experience and on their own time. This is a blatant and egregious attack on trans students in the Commonwealth and puts innocent children under harsh and brutal scrutiny for just trying to live their lives as who they truly are.  We have to show that trans kids matter, trans people matter, and that they should be uplifted and supported, not persecuted and oppressed.  As a resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I urge you to do away with this policy and get back to supporting ALL of our Virginia public school students. ",130360,9/26/22  12:48pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130360

Anonymous ,Opposed,"While much of the proposed policy seems reasonable and well-balanced to support parents, I oppose the proposed policy. Outing trans and/or LGBT+ students to their parents without their consent will result in increased homelessness and suicide. How do schools intend to support the very students they will assuredly make homeless and/or suicidal? Please see: https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/homelessness-and-housing-instability-among-lgbtq-youth-feb-2022/. Additionally, the proposed policy is vague in addressing trans students with their preferred pronouns using parental consent as guidance. How do schools intend to address students whose parents are divorced or were never married, share equal custody, but disagree on how their child should be addressed at school? Whatsmore, how do schools intend to enforce how trans students are addressed by teachers, administrators, and staff? If a parent instructs their child's school to address them with their preferred name and pronouns, will school staff face consequences for refusing to do so? It would seem not, based on this proposed policy. This proposed policy does little to protect trans students in the care of Virginia schools. It should be opposed and, at a minimum, revised to address the above concerns.",,9/26/22  12:48pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130368

Kevin Saucedo-Broach ,Younkin's anti-trans policies are a stain on Virginia,"As a citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I am adamantly against the Governor's model policies concerning trans students. These policies are vindictive, intended to trap queer children and chain them to the whims of their parents—in the face of decades of evidence that queer children often suffer much of the worst abuse from their own families. The trans community at large faces some of the highest rates of violence, depression, and suicide within the queer community, making these rules especially pernicious and cruel. Glenn Youngkin is just another in a long line of weak, feeble men willing to accumulate personal power and political capital by beating on a group of people with little say in their own affairs.  The good people of Virginia have fought and defeated men like him in the past. My ancestor, a Virginian, did as much when we knocked the British out of the colonies. I have every confidence that we shall do so again.

Dr Richard Spoeler ,Child Mutilation Must Be stopped,Telling children they can be a different gender is the same thing as telling them they can be a different ethnicity. Cutting off childrens body parts is demonic. How would you respond to a child who said he or she felt like he or she was meant to only have one arm and that their body feels wrong to them with two. Would you allow them to cut that painful arm off,130453,9/26/22  12:52pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130453
Maureen B-P ,A child's right to feel safe at school and at home supersedes a parent's rights,"We accept that there are limits on people's rights when they result in the injury of others.  Hence the oft cited quote, ""Your right to swing your fist ends at my nose.""  We use this principal to protect children from corporal punishment at school (Virginia Code 22.1-279.1) and from sexual assault anywhere (Virginia Code 18.2-370).  (Maslow cited the need for safety as one of the basic needs for human development.)   Transgender students have the right to feel safe in their bodily and mental integrity as does every child.  Anything that endangers that sense of safety should not be tolerated.  Transgender children have a suicide risk of 2.5 times greater than the norm.  (Price-Feeney, Myeshia et al. ""Understanding the Mental Health of Transgender and Nonbinary Youth"" Journal of Adolescent Health, vol. 66, Issue 6, June 1, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.11.314) Therefore, teachers should not be compelled to tell parents if their child is transgender.  Everyone should respect the pronouns that a person chooses for themselves.  A fundamental part of our common humanity is our ability to say who we are.  Ensuring that people can do that safely no matter what their age is not granting them special rights but affirming their equal rights.",,9/26/22  12:52pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130455

"Kate, LGBT former student ",Strongly opposed and disgusted,"I am a young adult in Hampton Roads who attended public schools here. I did not have a safe and supportive environment to be myself at home. Teachers who loved, supported, and encouraged me to love myself no matter my identity were what kept me not only able to study and learn, but what kept me ALIVE. Trans youth deserve safety and respect. I attempted suicide at age 17; these guidelines are going to result in a huge increase in depressed and suicidal LGBT youth, and Virginia's teen suicide rate is already higher than the national average. The science shows LGBT youth are at an increased risk of suicide, particularly Transgender youth as they are unwillingly dragged into the public eye to have their humanity debated. Meanwhile the same studies also show using Trans youth's chosen names and correct pronouns significantly lowers that suicide risk. Again, this policy is going to scar and kill children. I have a lot of friends who are teachers, and if these guidelines pass they aren't going to follow them because they have no interest in harming their beloved students.

I'm living proof: cisgender and opposed to this guidance, which as written, will only serve to cut off trans students from one of the dwindling number of public spaces that take steps to affirm their existence. Many students cannot rely on their parents to provide a safe environment in which to navigate their gender identity, and if we are to continue with the assumption that schools are meant to serve every student, we cannot in good conscience blunt our schools' ability to actively assist a specific underserved demographic. Make no mistake: that is what this guidance is designed to do.

Parent rights are hampered under this new policy, by requiring them to provide additional evidence and documentation to have their wishes followed in school beyond what current policies require. This policy is simply making it more difficult for kids to transition socially, rather than involving parents more deeply. In addition, it allows greater freedom of speech to members of school staff if their views are in alignment with the governor, instead of allowing equal rights to all educators. Finally, despite lip service to providing safe and secure environment to all children, it is endangering the mental health and safety of some of our most vulnerable students.  It is a terrible policy that should not be enforced in any school system.",130562,9/26/22  12:57pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130562

Future School Counselor ,Strongly Oppose! ,"56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020). Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for transgender males and 149% for transgender females (Murchison et al., 2019). 28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020). Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked out or abused (Thoma, 2021).

Tipton ,Strongly Opposed,"Since this guidance will regulate names, nicknames, and pronouns, it begs the question if non trans students will be allowed to go by nicknames unless explicit permission is given by parent's that their child can go by that nickname.  Must Bill go by William or Jon go by Jonathan?  I doubt it.  This is clearly targetting trans children and unfortunately will hurt those whose parents already do not support them.  It is shameful, unnecessary, and detrimental to those children.  Believe people are who they say they are.  If a child born as raised as a gender aliging with their birth sex would like to go by another gender, believe that there is something valid to that claim.  It shouldn't be a matter of asking permission.  Would we ask parents of gay student to give permission that their children can be gay?  Why not have checklist at the beginning of the school year each parent must fill out to specify who their children can date?  If a heterosexual white student wants to date a black student, do they need their parent's permission?  Trans students already face many hurdles in their day to day lives.  This guidance would simply reaffirm to them that there is something wrong with them, and it is so grievously abnormal that they must get permission to be who they are.  It's absolutely ridiculous that the government is wasting time, policing individuals just trying to live their lives.  Why not spend time of housing, affordability, infrastructure, and leave trans children alone.  Enacting this policy is foolish on many levels.  I am strongly opposed and embarrassed this is even up for debate in 2022.",130569,9/26/22  12:57pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130569
Anonymous ,Strongly OPPOSE ,"These proposed policies to “protect” parents and staff rights will directly impact our family and thousands of others. While our child feels safe enough to be themself at home, many children do not have the same support from their parents. Current school policies in VA have allowed schools to be a place where many queer/trans kids can feel safe to be themselves, be relaxed and ready to learn, and not suffer repercussions at home. Taking away that sanctuary will have direct negative social, emotional AND educational impacts on too many students, including students who are cisgender who will watch the impact thirst change have on their peers. Under the current policy, we, as parents, were permitted to submit written instructions to the school to change our student’s name and gender on official school records, WITHOUT legal documentation. The new policy would require us to get a court order and legal name and gender change in order to maintain that. That is a process we would like to take when we are ready, not because the department of education requires it. What about our parent rights?!

A Edwards ,OPPOSED - the proposed changes will endanger transgender students,"This comment is in response to ""2022 MODEL POLICIES ON THE PRIVACY, DIGNITY, AND RESPECT FOR ALL STUDENTS AND PARENTS IN VIRGINIA’S PUBLIC SCHOOLS."" As written, implementation of the guidelines will contribute to harassment and discrimination of transgender students, and will result in higher prevalences of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The guidance specifically allows for teachers and other school staff to engage in behavior that has been empirically shown to be harmful to transgender students, including ""deadnaming"" them and refusing to use their preferred pronouns. Many students - regardless of gender identity - do not feel safe in their homes, and this is especially true for transgender students who are not fortunate enough to live in homes with family members who support them. For those students, schools often represent a place for safe self-expression. The proposed guidance would remove that safety, leaving them with no outlet for being themselves. In addition to formally educating the students of the Commonwealth, schools provide opportunities for social and emotional learning, and we all owe it to every student to continue to provide those opportunities in a safe and welcoming environment. Giving teachers - who signed up for the job to presumably help shepherd students through their childhood and adolescence with care and support - the leeway to impose their own personal anti-transgender ideology on students by refusing to acknowledge their identity is counter to the positive role that school should play in students' lives.  I conduct research on depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The empirical evidence clearly indicates that, among transgender students, having supportive teachers and schools can lead to reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidality; it can also lead to lower levels of substance use. Also, having supporting adult role models who respect transgender students' pronouns and name preferences sets the standard for students' peers, making them less likely to engage in bullying of transgender students. In contrast, the discriminatory behavior that will be enabled by the proposed guidance is likely to increase bullying by peers, because the teachers themselves will be able to engage in bullying! By stifling students' free expression of their identity, members of the school system who disregard name and pronoun preferences will directly contribute to negative mental health outcomes among these students. The guidelines will subject transgender students to the anguish that attends being forced to use bathrooms inconsistent with their identity - imagine being a 14-year-old transgender girl who is forced to use the men's bathroom with 18-year-old male students! Furthermore, the provision that single-use bathroom be available is a pie-in-the-sky idea: Given how little this administration cares about providing resources for schools in general, coupled with Youngkin's clear antipathy toward transgender students, the notion that there would be sufficient funds made available for schools to install these new bathroom is ridiculous. There are schools in the Richmond Public School system that don't have enough money for paper - do you think they can afford to install a new bathroom? These new guidelines are written in such bad faith. It's framed as being a ""parents' rights"" policy, but even in cases where parents are supportive of their transgender children, the new guidance would make it possible for teachers to discriminate against transgender kids. The text is clearly all written to make things more difficult for transgender students and their supportive parents, while making it easier for hateful anti-trans teachers and school staff to bully students and refuse to acknowledge their identity. This is so disappointing and so transparent. If implemented, please know that everyone who makes these policies a reality will be responsible for the negative mental health outcomes - including suicidal behavior among trans students - that ensue.",130604,9/26/22  12:59pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130604

Stephanie Bowers ,"I object wholeheartedly to this policy, motivated solely by political tomfoolery and bigotry","This will lead to the abuse of trans children and their further ostracizing amongst peers and staff at a time when children need the most support. School is for learning, not for the policing of a student’s gender expression to win political points. You will turn teachers, counselors, support staff and administrators into an unwilling gestapo, a band of reluctant informers who no trans children can turn to as a confidante the way all of their other schoolmates are able to do. As an educator I would resign before I would be forced to shame my students for their gender expression and possibly cause them great harm by outing them against their will. The blood of children will be on your hands and I am many other educators and staff will never be a part of it. ",130623,9/26/22  1:00pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130623

Sarah ,VDOE Model Policies in re:transgender students,"I strongly and whole-heartedly disagree with the policies set forth in regards to our gay and transgender students. This policy is essentially forcing schools, staff, coaches and admin to out students who do not feel safe or affirmed in their homes. These students are not the property of their parents. They are living, breathing human beings with rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution. Their rights do not end at the schoolhouse doors. These students deserve a quality education and a safe environment to learn free from discrimination. I am a parent of an LGBTQ student. Fortunately for him, he has a loving and affirming family surrounding him where he did feel safe, but he still chose when HE was ready to confide in me and his father. I am aware some of his friends do not have that luxury. If a child does not feel safe coming out to their parents, that burden to bear is on the parents. It is not the job of the school system to notify a parent of a student's change in name, pronouns, gender or sex. Do not force our public schools to put our most vulnerable students in harms way for the sake of politics and religion. ",130626,9/26/22  1:00pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130626

Joey Murphy ,Strongly Opposed - The Kids Matter Too,"This model has its priorities incredibly backwards. Children aren't just property of their parents, they're their own human beings. By requiring parent's permission for the correct pronouns to be used, you're robbing thousands of students the only chance they'll get at validation for the first 18 years of their life. Many students don't have the luxury of supportive parents, and school is the only chance they get to live as their true selves. Governor Youngkin, imagine if you needed a parent's permission to be called a boy. What would that do to you mentally? Suicide is already the leading cause of death in people aged 10 to 24 (Hedegaard, Curtin, & Warner, 2018), and when the person is LGBTQ+ with unsupportive family, they are 4 times more likely to attempt suicide (Johns et al., 2019; Johns et al., 2020). Remember; The people of Virginia includes the children of Virginia, and this model explicitly endangers countless transgender kids who just want to live their life with support from teachers and peers. Parents aren't in any danger if their kids are using different pronouns at school than at home, but their children will be at a much higher risk of suicide if you take away the one place they can be themselves if their home isn't safe.   Sources: Johns, M.

Don Whiteside ,These proposed policies enshrine treating students poorly and should not be implemented,"These proposed policies (2022 Model Policies on the privacy, dignity, and respect for all students and parents in Virginia's public schools) are lousy and predicated on several poor assumptions. They use disingenuous language to enshrine bad choices and completely ignore the reality of marginalized populations and what their family lives are often like, all in the service of letting adults who should know better to treat them as less than their fellow students. The claim that this is somehow necessary in order to align with the statement that a “parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent’s child” is a deliberately obtuse reading. A parent absolutely has ""a fundamental right to make decisions concerning"" their child. This in no way requires that a parent be involved in making every decision regarding their child, and our schools would crumble if this policy was actually implemented across the board. We would laugh out loud at the idea that it would be necessary to get a parent's explicit permission to use whatever ""name [or] nickname"" a child might request. I would comfortably bet that a teacher has sent home a form requesting permission to call their student, named ""Elisabeth,"" by the name of ""Peggy"" or ""Liz"" exactly zero times in the history of the Commonwealth. At the age of fifty-two I have had exactly zero authority figures argue with my request to be called ""Don"" rather than my legal name of ""Donald."" Not one teacher has ever refused because it's not the name on my birth certificate. I would also wager that no student who commonly goes by their middle name rather than their first name has ever been asked to provide parental permission. I believe without reservation that the Skips and Trips and Juniors walk free through school halls. Unless all of these situations are now going to require paperwork it seems clear that this claim that parents must be involved in these decisions is a fig leaf for enabling the targeting of a specific group of people. Similarly this claim that the engaging of common courtesy - addressing people by the name they request, rather than insisting that a birth certificate is somehow sacrosanct - is too much to ask of our civil servants is ridiculous. I doubt a person would last one minute in Jeff Goettman's office if they insisted they must only address him as Jeffery. It certainly seems like it's okay for official publications. So please spare me the claim that asking that same basic courtesy for our transgendered youth is too much. Anyone who finds the application of manners towards the students entrusted into the state's care to be too great a lift should find other employment, assuming they can find somewhere that would employ someone who won't address a person with basic respect. More briefly: the claim in II. C that this act will be implemented so that ""no student is discriminated against or harassed on the basis of his or her sex"" is simply incompatible with the ridiculous assertion in in V. C. that ""compelling others to use preferred pronouns"" is a First Amendment violation. Any number of other basic human behaviours could be thrown out with this ridiculous claim. Many kinds of racist behaviour could be excused by this. None of it belongs in our schools. People who cannot muster up this common courtesy because of their own gender bigotry should seek other employment and not be sheltered by State policy. These kids come into schools with the expectation of basic courtesy and respect and they are even legally compelled to do so. To then refuse to grant them basic courtesy and autonomy over their own identities is abhorrent.",,9/26/22  1:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130676

Peter ,Fully support change in transgender policies. ,"My youngest daughter just started middle school, and she should not be forced to be “fully exposed” to transgender demands or policies that violate her God given rights. Why should her rights be violated in bathrooms or locker rooms by way of allowing biologically born males in the same place at the same time?  Neither should they see her undressed, nor should she be forced to see them undressed. (The first time it happens, we are going to have a problem).  Her rights as an innocent child should be protected and promoted by way of limiting her exposure and forced participation in gender dysphoria.  Furthermore, the promotion of gender dysphoria behind the backs of parents is an absolute affront to parental rights. If children are confused about their gender, that is something their parents should be directly involved in and have full oversight over. Our children are not wards of the state. It’s sad that grown adults are peddling falsehoods to influence our children behind our backs…secretly and covertly, and without our express approval are willing participation. ",130691,9/26/22  1:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130691

Timothy Scott ,This change will kill children,"The document currently in effect specifies that transgender children are at a drastically increased risk of homelessness due to abusive families. Therefore, school personnel are to treat a child's gender identity as private information, even from the child's parents. The proposed new document reverses this, and actively encourages teachers to tell parents about their children's gender identity. This will result in more children being abused and abandoned by their families, which will lead to more children dying of starvation, exposure, or suicide.   Anyone who votes in favor of this proposal is voting in favor of killing children.

Melody Olvera ,Strongly oppose; this will hurt trans kids ,"Transgender children should have the freedom to explore their gender as they see fit, even while young. It is the responsibility of those around them to be accommodating and respectful of these freedoms  or else risk doing real mental damage to them. To this extent, it is imperative that transgender students be able to request a preferred name and pronouns that differ from their biological sex. It is also imperative that they be allowed to use the same bathrooms as others of the gender they identify with. This proposed policy will ostracize trans gender children and is explicitly not respectful  of transgender children’s needs and panders to the unfounded feelings of cisgender people and parents. Trans kids deserve protections at school  that allow them to be their whole selves without being outed or ostracized  by their teachers and peers. Disallowing preferred pronouns and names will lead to outing and ostracizing of trans kids; this goes against the stated purpose of this document.

Vincent Webb ,"leveraging the pain and humiliation of children for power, and it is unquestionably wrong","I strongly  oppose the new model policies for Virginia schools. This is a step backwards to a harsher, more violent time. Studies have shown again and again that honoring the name and identity of transgender youth is measurable suicide prevention. These policies are not evidence based, as they are mandated to be, and so should be ineligible for presentation or adoption. Trans students are not dominating tournaments or harming the opportunities or their cis peers. Trans students are not a threat to student safety, yet they do face bullying and violence themselves. These policies could out students in unsafe living environments, adding dangers to them not only within the school grounds, but at home as well. The cynical culture wars this administration are engaging in for their own political gain, will lead to very real harm, harm against some of those most vulnerable in society at large. It is leveraging the pain and humiliation of children for power, and it is unquestionably wrong. ",130747,9/26/22  1:06pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130747

Andrew B ,Youngkin’s Policy Against Trans Youth is a Violation of Human Rights,"The policies that Youngkin sets forth to implement against LGBTQ students is a violation of human rights, and is a threat against the livelihood of these children. Outing a student for being Gay, Bi, Trans, Nonbinary. etc opens up the student for the possibility of physical violence, as well as various forms of assault and discriminatory practices. These students have the right to live life how they wish without having to worry for their safety and without dealing with the trauma involved with public scrutiny and violence by those that object.",130801,9/26/22  1:08pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130801

Benjamin Walsh ,Strongly oppose the new guidelines,"If a kid wants to test out going by a different name or trying out a different haircut, what harm does that cause society at large?  We are focusing too much on what parents want their kids to be and not enough on how their kids feel. If the parents won't support them at home, the kid should be able to at least have some reprieve from their control at school where they can be themselves.  Trans people have a hard enough time as-is without all this effort being spent on attacking them by a national political party. There are many other issues that need attention that could actually do some good for Virginia, but instead these new guidelines are focused on bullying some LGBTQ kids for clout. Keep the old guidelines, they were fine. These new ones will only cause harm to kids.",130806,9/26/22  1:09pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130806

childcare worker ,Concerned,"Children are people; they possess thoughts and feelings and control over their own actions. Though, as adults, we often limit the expression of these things for a variety of reasons; so much of our kids' lives are already so thoroughly regimented and controlled by the world they live in. Why do we punish them for asking for respect and autonomy concerning matters of personal expression/autonomy that do not  inherently hurt themselves nor others? Being openly transgender and/or gender non-conforming involves a person offering a certain amount of trust and vulnerability to those around them. I am sad to see actions that do not recognize, or, recognize and reject, the opportunity to help and protect these people -- these children. How we treat people systemically influences how individuals view and treat groups, as well as how people view and treat themselves. Being trans is not inherently a spectacle or shock (certainly not for the people who have lived with themselves their whole life); it's our choice to turn it into one. So far, this reaction of treating transness as unusual and unprecedented has bred an environment of intense scrutiny surrounding gender expression, appearance, and interests. This not only hurts trans people, it hurts everyone. Even if you fear and do not understand transness, you likely understand that forcing children into prescribed ways of living, thinking, playing, and, dressing, and enjoying based solely on gender is a bit silly. What about being a girl inherently means you can't or shouldn't like traditionally ""boy"" things, e.g. playing with toy cars, or, being a doctor? What about being a boy inherently means you can't or shouldn't like traditionally ""girl"" things, e.g. wearing pink, or, styling hair? Gender roles, expectations, and presentation change constantly and consistently throughout time and place. Why do we feel the need to hurt and alienate children -- people -- in order to avoid listening to those we might not immediately understand? Transgender kids will not stop being trans due to being ignored and mistreated, they will only stop feeling safe enough to be open about their existence. When trans kids cease to exist under these sorts of systems, it's generally due to harm inflicted by self, others, and/or the environment they live in. In summary, I would like for kids to grow up in a world that's safe; where they can be honest and respected without hurting themselves for others. When we foster an environment where kids feel confident in their autonomy and ability to express themselves, then we as adults can more easily and effectively help them if and when children encounter difficulty. Kids are not our enemies, they are people learning how to function in the world we've created and maintain. Do we want kids to grow up being told, implicitly or explicitly, that they deserve respect, basic hygienic facilities, to be heard -- to live -- only when they pretend to be what adults say they must be?  Please reconsider.",130842,9/26/22  1:11pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130842

MSEd ,"Strongly support proposed 2022 Model Policies (Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all students/paren ","I strongly support the 2022 Model Policies on the ‘The Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools,’ and am grateful for the responsiveness of Gov Youngkin and the VDOE in their efforts of rescinding and replacing the radical and potentially dangerous 2021 Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools under Gov Northam. This rewritten 2022 policy safeguards and restores parental rights and values in the upbringing and education of their children.  The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or religious beliefs, such as the forced use of ‘gender identity’ pronouns. Moreover, the 14th Amendment in our Constitution gives parents a ""fundamental right to direct the upbringing and education of their children."" Under the previous 2021 Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students Gov Northam 'disregarded the rights of parents' and also ""promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools” aka ‘indoctrination and social engineering.’ The previous policy usurped parental authority and gave new meaning to ‘Right to Privacy’ —meaning the school/teachers protected student ‘privacy’ and withheld minors’ transgender transitions, gender identities and sexual orientation from their parents/legal guardians UNLESS they had the students’ permission to do so.  The former policy also gave males with gender dysphoria access to bathrooms and other areas where females disrobe, and overnight travel accommodations for school trips, thus violating the females’ right to privacy.  This same restroom policy was in place at the Loudoun County (Virginia) Public Schools, which reportedly covered up a 15-year-old girl being raped and sodomized in a stall by a teenage boy wearing a skirt. This same teenage boy was transferred to another public school where he attacked another female student.  This revised 2022 policy will keep biological boys out of the Girls Public School Bathrooms and other designated female areas with provisions for a separate space for transgenders to use.  Virginia's Department of Education states that the word ""sex"" means biological sex.  The policies also define ""transgender student"" as ""a public school student whose parent has requested in writing, due to their child’s persistent and sincere belief that his or her gender differs with his or her sex, that their child be so identified while at school.""  This is a common sense policy that ensures ALL students are treated with dignity and respect and provides positive and safe learning environments for ALL students.  It’s a huge step in a positive direction for families and students.",,9/26/22  1:13pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130888

"Stair Z Calhoun, Network NOVA ","Privacy, Dignity, and Respect Policies","These model policies are rooted in transphobia and only seek to further harm trans and non-binary kids. As we all know in 2021, Governor Ralph Northam signed the Virginia Values Act into law after it was passed through the General Assembly. This law sweepingly, effectively prohibited discrimination in public and private employment, credit, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among other additional protected categories. The protections in this act have been extended to protect LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia public schools throughout the Commonwealth to prohibit discrimination, harassment, and violence in against these students.  Governor Youngkin's proposed policies explicitly contradict state law and are illegal. ",130910,9/26/22  1:14pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130910

Daniel Mosier ,"I Oppose This Cruel, Anti-Education Policy","I oppose this draft document in the strongest possible terms. Even if you leave aside the cruel way these proposed policies target any children who may be questioning their gender identities (and you shouldn’t leave that aside), this is a piece of education guidance that will only worsen the quality of education for Virginia children. When you create a policy that singles out and stigmatizes children for their differences, the only thing they will be able to focus on is their safety, NOT their education. When these kids should be spending their school years focused on learning, figuring out who they are and gaining new experiences, they will spend their entire day looking over their shoulders and wondering if they will have to face state-sanctioned discrimination. As someone who was bullied as a kid, I know the psychic toll that being singled out for your differences can have at a young age. This is an experience that no child should be forced to go through, and knowing that these policies will foster even worse experiences for children, forcing them to be singled out not just by their peers but by their teachers (who should be protecting them) and a society that is fearful of what they represent, is a devastating reality to confront. And for those who think that these policies will only ever affect the “different” kids that you are so afraid of, recognize that every single kid who will be stigmatized by these policies has friends who will worry over the well-being of their buddy, or teachers who won’t be able to provide the best instruction possible out of fear of retaliation or inadvertently doing damage to a student, or parents who will suffer at work and at home because of what their kid is going through at school. The ripple effects from this legislation will be massive and devastating, and the damage done to those affected will last a lifetime. I recommend that the Virginia Department of Education scrap this entire proposed document and re-write their guidance to actually focus on increasing the quality of education in our state, instead of worsening it for all but the most hateful and vindictive adults in the seats of power.",130964,9/26/22  1:16pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130964

Irene ,Strongly Opposed : A Concerned Citizen and How This Relates to NC's HB-2,"   Hello,     I have been thinking about this and how I am going to say it since it dropped on 9/16/2022 about the Youngkin Administration’s education policies on how they treat LGBTQ+ kids and public educators. I could not standby and be silent about it. To say this, it is transphobic and bullying behavior of the Youngkin Administration to put policies like this, but it is not surprising because of how the Youngkins’s are as people, especially the fact that the governor and First Lady of Virginia are insecure and mean people that care about showing off how rich they are and will do anything to be popular and put money in their pocket books. Hate and Discrimination will and should not be tolerated anywhere, that includes a school setting.         Even though I live next door in NC, here in NC while I was a freshman in college, NC in 2016 passed a bill called HB-2 that targeted trans people and let me tell you, it was embarrassing and also insulting towards the LGBTQ+ community and it made NC not an inclusive place at the time. Passing policies that discriminate the LGBTQ+ community like these examples are putting the lives of LGBTQ+ people and their families at risk and it’s not ok to do this anymore. It is not Christian to hate people that are different from you. It is not in good faith to hold an inaugural party at the time of when cases were high with no safety precautions towards covid that put an entire commonwealth and neighboring states at risk of getting sick.  It goes to show how the Youngkin Family, in my opinion are unauthentic and selfish people that pretend to care about everyone but they do not care about anyone. For example, when Suzanne Youngkin in a video said that “she married a winner” with her kids laughing in the background on election night, I know who she bullied specifically that night and that and example of that shows that she was being insensitive and also shows her insecurities by her behavior.      When Glenn and his staff bullied a teenager in February, specifically his press secretary Macaulay Porter, his apology was not an apology at all. It wouldn’t surprise me if their four kids bullied anyone and I hope in writing this that if any of Glenn and Suzanne’s friends and family, including their kids friends and former classmates that do not agree with their behavior and have been questioning it for the last eight months, yet alone, not feel good about any of it, including this policy the Youngkin Administration put out on outing LGBTQ+ kids, I understand it is an awkward and hard position to be in, but honestly, it is time to speak up against their behavior because it is hurting so many people and it is all on you to do the right thing. The silence is unacceptable. For the entire LGBTQ+ community, I standby you and will be standing up alongside you because you deserve to be treated with respect and love, especially in school. Plus, please vote in the election if you do not agree with the policy.     Also,  Shame on the Youngkin Administration     Resources: Youngkin Education Policy:  https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=C%3A%5CTownHall%5Cdocroot%5CGuidanceDocs_Proposed%5C201%5CGDoc_DOE_6284_20220915.pdf&fbclid=IwAR3MPJRPRHfJuwNV_DWvaN_SztYenhmh1B0aMI1WGepJiJTynDYbKB7lv48   Video at 4:49 of Suzanne Youngkin's line of ""Married A Winner"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRdOARivdsU   NC HB-2 in 2016 : https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2015E2/Bills/House/PDF/H2v3.pdf Picture of the Inaugural Party In January : https://www.instagram.com/p/CYxeXFwN0zb/?igshid=NDRkN2NkYzU=   Trans Youth Death Rate:  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32345113/",,9/26/22  1:18pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=130998

On top of that - what is transgender exactly? There is no medical test, no psychological test. There is no consistent legal standard such as in the UK (where they require a gender recognition certificate). If the only standard is ""this boy now says she's a girl"", then that's useless and unworkable for your typical public school.

You are a retard if you agree with this law and if this goes through you do not care about the kids you only care about you and your selfish bias.

Taylor Lianne Chandler ,Stop discriminating and performing child abuse,"The harm that comes from making a child be something they are not is life long. It makes no sense to go out of your way as a governor or school administrator to hurt children. We know who we are, no one has to look between their legs to know their identity. Outing Trans youth can have deadly consequences. After doing what you propose and they react feeling hopeless trapped and alone and decided to kill themselves you should be head responsible for their death. You want to do the right thing, not cause harm to a child. Stop this madness and allow kids to be themselves. They only person it seems to hurt is you, so I suggest you get help, counseling and come to terms with your need to harm children. Kids should be called by their name, allowed to express themselves, go to the bathroom in piece and allowed to participate in sports if they so desire. Think of the lawsuits and money you will expend taking on this perverse act of yours against children. If you have kids, I feel sorry for them and the legacy you will leave them as an abuser of children over an entire state. You are going to Trump your hate over their medical help and well being. When did you become smarter than doctors in objecting to their medical care?  Stop the insanity before it’s too late and children are lost! ",131015,9/26/22  1:19pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131015

Patricia Hayward ,Very stronly opposed,"Hello, I am writing to express my displeasure and strong disagreement with the current proposed changes to existing model policy for trans and non-binary students. This policy is targeting a marginalized group at their most vulnerable--in schools--and working on the false assumption that parents will always work in the best interest of their child with regards to trans and non binary issues. This policy allows for teachers and counselors to potentially become informants to parents regarding gender/trans issues and leave children with no confidential allies to seek support and guidance.  Children are not guaranteed acceptance by their own parents if they are outed as trans or non-binary and in fact parental rejection likely contributes to the high rate of suicide and substance abuse that many trans and non binary people are prey to. I am the mother of a trans child and while they were not trans while they were a student in FCPS, they did have peers who were, and the emotional issues that their peers faced were significant. I can't imagine how much worse things might have been if a policy such as the proposed one were in place then.  ",131027,9/26/22  1:20pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131027

Anonymous ,Advocate,"Good morning,   I am writing about the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools. As a school counselor and resident of Virginia I do not agree with the policy that is currently being proposed.    The ASCA National Model that we follow also raises several points of concern between the policy and the guidelines that school counselors set out to follow. I have provided some key components from the model below: A. RESPONSIBILITY TO STUDENTS  A.1. Supporting Student Development  School counselors:  Have a primary obligation to the students, who are to be treated with dignity and respect as unique individuals.  Foster and affirm all students and their identity and psychosocial development.  h. Respect students’ and families’ values, beliefs and cultural background, as well as students’ sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, and exercise great care to avoid imposing personal biases, beliefs or values rooted in one’s religion, culture or ethnicity.  J.  Advocate for equitable, anti-oppressive and anti-bias policies and procedures, systems and practices, and provide effective, evidence-based and culturally sustaining interventions to address student needs.  A. 10. Marginalized Populations  School counselors:  Advocate with and on behalf of students to ensure they remain safe at home, in their communities and at school. A high standard of care includes determining what information is shared with parents/guardians and when information creates an unsafe environment for students.  Actively work to establish a safe, equitable, affirming school environment in which all members of the school community demonstrate respect, inclusion and acceptance.  E. Understand and advocate for all students’ right to be treated in a manner that honors and respects their identity and   expression, including but not limited to race, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, language and ability status, and to be free from any form of discipline, harassment or discrimination based on their identity or expression.  F. Advocate for the equitable right and access to free, appropriate public education for all youth in which students are not stigmatized or isolated based on race, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, language, immigration status, juvenile justice/court involvement, housing, socioeconomic status, ability, foster care, transportation, special education, mental health and/or any other exceptionality or special need.    Virginia School Counselors Association also raises valid points. Below those are listed: “VSCA recognizes that: 56% of transgender youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. School belongingness mitigates these risks and is a significant predictor variable for reducing suicidal ideation and attempts among transgender youth (Austin et al., 2020). Transgender and nonbinary youth whose schools prevent them from using the restrooms/locker rooms that best matched their gender identities were significantly more likely to be sexually assaulted, 26% for transgender males and 149% for transgender females (Murchison et al., 2019). 28% of transgender youth whose pronouns are not affirmed attempted suicide in the past year. In fact, when pronouns are respected, transgender youth attempted suicide at half the rate of those who did not have their pronouns respected (Trevor Project, 2020). Transgender adolescents experience significantly disproportionate levels of childhood abuse compared to cisgender adolescents and experience greater levels of homelessness as a result of being kicked out or abused (Thoma, 2021). Fewer than 2.5% of transgender youth re-transition to cisgender (Olson et al, 2022). Virginia school counselors work to remove barriers and support the social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students. VSCA Ends Policies state that “Virginia School Counselors are committed to working with and advocating for marginalized groups, promote the mental health and wellness of all students, adhere to the ASCA Ethical Standards for School Counselors, and actively work to dismantle destructive systemic inequities.” Additionally, Virginia school counselors follow the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Position Statement on The School Counselor and Transgender and Nonbinary Youth (Adopted 2016, revised 2022) that states:  School counselors work to safeguard the well-being of transgender and nonbinary youth. School counselors recognize all students have the right to be treated equally and fairly, with dignity and respect as unique individuals, free from discrimination, harassment and bullying based on their gender identity and gender expression. Finally, Virginia school counselors seek to create environments that are not only inclusive and equitable for all students, including our transgender, nonbinary, gender non-conforming and gender-fluid students, but that celebrate the full scope of their identities, allowing them to thrive and reach their fullest potential. Furthermore, Virginia school counselors commit to dismantling any and all forms of inequity in Virginia’s public education system and fully support LGBTQ+ students. Every Virginia student, regardless of their gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation, has a right to learn free from discrimination and harassment.” To conclude I do not believe that this policy is promoting equality amongst our students. I believe that this is giving more power to the parents and oftentimes the only place the students feel safe is at school and this is taking that away from them. If we have to contact a parent for permission and then not meet the request of the student due to the parents answer we are not doing any service to our students. We are supposed to be here for each student and this policy is not helping to show that we support all of our students no matter what. I hope that this is taken into consideration and that changes are made so that we are able to serve all students without the boundaries that are set in this new policy. Really the policy is for the parents and not reflective of student needs at all and this should not be the case nor will it be useful in progression in the school setting.    ",,9/26/22  1:20pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131039

Kristin S. ,Protect Trans Kids,"As both a Christian and a mother of a trans child, I oppose this change in policy. What would you like to be called at work, Governor Youngkin?  What if I said it was my first amendment right to call you Mrs. Oldkin? Because my religion doesn't believe in men or in the word 'young'?  We only believe in old women.  We worship Carol Burnett, Julie Andrews, and Judi Dench.  So, now you're Mrs. Oldkin. And I'm only going to address you by she/her pronouns (because I don't believe in men). But, wait, that's not who you are, is it? And it doesn't really matter if my religion does or does not believe in men, men exist.  And it doesn't really matter if my religion does or does not believe in the word 'young', because that word is accepted by most people as a legitimate and inoffensive word that describes people under a certain age. Transgender people exist. Transgender is not a sin or a vice. Transgender (particularly early transitions, like my child) is generally accepted by the medical and psychological community as a legitimate difference in brain structure that matches the gender they are claiming. Everyone has the right to determine how they are addressed by others. You won the election, so you get to be Governor.  You inherited your last name, and you want to claim it. Thus, you're Governor Youngkin.  If I walked into the Governor's mansion and started addressing you as Mrs. Oldkin, it would be offensive, even if I was doing it ""with a good heart."" It's not how you've asked to be addressed.  This new ""model policy"" effectively does that for every transgender child who has done the difficult and brave work of discovering who they truly are and ask to be addressed by their affirmed gender, name and pronouns. This policy is offensive, prioritizing the comfort and feelings of people who have done absolutely no research to understand the issue at hand.",131063,9/26/22  1:22pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131063

Anonymous ,Keep CA out of VA,"This is a terrible policy decision. Do do itt ! Watching the government attack a tiny minority by attempting to legislate them out of existence is unbelievably disheartening. This is not in line with the will of all Virginia parents. Please stop acting as if this is on our behalf. It’s not. Your religious crusade against LGBTQ students and teachers is noted and opposed.  I am completely opposed. I am strongly opposed. It is a grave mistake to pass this. The 2021 policy enacted by the Department of Education created guidance to school boards and schools that protected trans and non-binary youth and provided an inclusionary learning environment for all students – exactly the role of public schools in our nation. This new proposed policy takes away protections that kids had to be free from harm in their learning environment, imposing standards that put them in danger in school and for some, at home. I urge the Board to reject this new policy and maintain the 2021 inclusive policy.  Schools are to act in the best interest of the child and protect children while in their care. We train educators to identify bullying behavior and signs of abuse in the home and the steps they can take to intervene. By forcing an educator to use ""birth assigned sex"" when determining names and pronouns of children and teens instead of respecting the student, this policy will out trans students who are socially transitioned but, for whatever reason, have not gone through the process to make legal changes, increasing their risk of assault and bullying. For some trans and non-binary students, school is the only safe space in their life and the educators they interact with who are respectful of them are the key protective factor that leads to survival. This policy will take that away from at-risk youth.  If this policy is enacted, suicides in LGBTQ+ youth, especially trans youth will increase. Bullying of these same youth will increase. Targeted attacks of these same youth will increase. These are hyperbolic statements, but facts based on data from organizations like the CDC, who recommend that schools provide safe spaces for all youth, especially LGBTQ+ youth to reduce teen suicides. A 2019 NIH study documented that real and perceived safety at school is a protective factor for trans students in reducing suicidal tendencies.  As a parent of a trans student, I implore you to prioritize the life of my child over the feelings of a few people with limited understanding of trans people. Prioritize saving children and keeping schools safe for every child, regardless of anyone's personal belief system. Reject this cruel policy.  Respectfully, Amanda L. Pohl, LMSW, MDiv, MS I oppose this fully. I am strongly opposed. I am strongly opposed. I oppose this fully. This will bring harm to trans kids. The trans ideology is destroying families.   These kids are being groomed to reject their families.   These kids need mental health support.   Changing their identities isn't going to help their future.   There is research out there that once they start this transformation that is when the risk of suicide increases.   Thank you Youngkin.   This is a terrible policy decision. This document is ageist, transphobic, and homophobic. The idea that students can't decide how they want to be addressed in class without parental permission is absolutely insane and outrageous. This targets trans youth blatantly and is clearly a strategy to prevent kids from coming out and force them to conform to ancient and outdated cis and heteronormative standards.  You are not ""helping"" anybody by forcing this conformity. Not allowing trans or nonbinary kids (nonbinary people are completely erased from this document) to use the pronouns they want or the names they want is absurd. Nobody would prevent ""Annabelle"" from going by ""Anna"" or a boy with long hair correcting his teacher for the pronouns he uses.  Additionally, asking students to be ""persistent and sincere"" in their requests for use of different names/pronouns ignores how fluid gender identity is. Where is there room for a person coming of age to be questioning and experimental? We let people who fit inside of the gender binary experiment with goth phases and religious involvement, why don't we extend the same courtesy to trans/nonbinary people with their gender identity and expression. We're not asking parents or teachers to get medically involved, this is basic human respect and dignity that we are stripping away from one of the least understood and valued groups in our society: our children. Additionally, the use of ""sex"" to refer to ""biological gender"" is extremely outdated. The proposal itself has to toggle back and forth between what words it uses because ""sex"" can refer to gender assigned at birth, the act of having sex, and sexual orientation. It would be easier for everyone if we stopped using this archaic language and started using ""gender assigned at birth"". Gender is a social construct. I am strongly opposed.

Anonymous ,Liberal Gay Mafia is coordinated attacking this board,"It is a grave mistake to pass this. Do not do this. I fully oppose this. Growing up in the 1980's I wondered what kind of person I would have been during the Civil Rights movement of the 1950's and 60's. I was sure that I would fight for Civil Rights. I imagined how embarrassed Senator Byrd and Governor J. Lindsay Almond must be now. I wondered how they could live with themselves. How could they have so much hate? But I now look at you Governor Youngkin and see the banality of hate. The ignorance that you and your supporters show is astounding. Has there ever been a situation where the people who were working against the civil rights of a group of children were considered to be in the right? You have aligned yourself with those who are the most destructive to continued human rights. US law protects parents' rights to raise their child, but not hurt their child. Parents have the right to control what information is shared within their home, but not what information is shared in the public school. School can teach what science has learned about evolution and what science has learned about sexuality and gender. Evolution is strongly supported by evidence. That gender is socially constructed and defined is strongly supported by evidence. The 2022 Model Policies sound as backwards/uneducated as a belief that illness is the result of unbalanced humors or witchcraft. I oppose this fully. Strongly oppose. This will bring harm to trans kids. It is a grave mistake to pass this. I am in support of the guidance document being proposed in Virginia for our schools.  Our girls are being assaulted and devalued by the policy of allowing males into female locker rooms, bathrooms, and sports teams. Parents have a right to know what is going on with their children, from birth into teenage years, without government interference.  Teachers should not be forced to walk the line on topics outside of EDUCATION.  My DIL quit teaching in PWC as she was not on board with the direction of education. Sex and gender identification does NOT belong in schools. Leave our kids alone.  They are being indoctrinated into not being comfortable in their own skin.  Transgender equality is already in place in our country without forcing everyone to take part. Stop the insanity in our schools! I fully oppose this. I oppose this fully. I support the effort to put rights back where they belong when it comes to parents and families.  Schools need to focus on reading, writing and history, the good and the bad, not gender studies. There are many comments on here about how this is bad for ""trans children."" You people are delusional. Children, by definition, are not competent to make such decisions. Most of them don't know what to wear, or what they should have for breakfast. And YOU who oppose this support letting them make life-altering decisions at an early age, when there is PLENTY of evidence of how much damage it can do to them later, when they have reached the age of competence and realize they have ruined their lives. People who believe there is such a thing as ""trans children"" are supporting child abuse. Of course, these same people also support killing babies, which are scientifically, biologically, viable humans from the time the egg is fertilized. Apparently, the facts are lost on such people, who only want to parrot abusive lies from their far left masters. Just like it was in the Soviet Union when I was growing up. Thank you, Gov Youngkin, for having the courage to stand up against the continuing lies and propaganda supported by those who would turn America into a socialist/communist backwater. Next, I suggest you invite the people who oppose this policy to move to one of the existing socialist/communist backwaters, where human rights are trampled and children are abused, and where parents have no say in how their children are raised - there are plenty of them available.  This will bring harm to trans kids. I oppose the discrimination of trans children in school. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. Transgender students are not villains or monsters, so stop treating them as such. They are people, trying to live their lives and be happy just like anyone else. Let them use the bathroom they choose. Respect their pronouns. Stop making their lives even more difficult.  The proposed policy is inhumane and cruel. It is impossible to type all the reasons why this policy is firstly unconstitutional and secondly a horrific piece of evil intent. Do not do this. I fully oppose this. Strongly oppose. It is important for the health of individuals to allow everyone to use the bathroom associated with their declared gender. It is in the best interest of every child that they are addressed by the name they associate with their being. Virginia should not be known for bigotry, prejudice and HATE. Strongly oppose.

Anonymous ,Liberal Gay Mafia is coordinated attacking this board,"I am in support of the guidance document being proposed in Virginia for our schools.  Our girls are being assaulted and devalued by the policy of allowing males into female locker rooms, bathrooms, and sports teams. Parents have a right to know what is going on with their children, from birth into teenage years, without government interference.  Teachers should not be forced to walk the line on topics outside of EDUCATION.  My DIL quit teaching in PWC as she was not on board with the direction of education. Sex and gender identification does NOT belong in schools. Leave our kids alone.  They are being indoctrinated into not being comfortable in their own skin.  Transgender equality is already in place in our country without forcing everyone to take part.

Most of them don't know what to wear, or what they should have for breakfast.

People who believe there is such a thing as ""trans children"" are supporting child abuse. Of course, these same people also support killing babies, which are scientifically, biologically, viable humans from the time the egg is fertilized. Apparently, the facts are lost on such people, who only want to parrot abusive lies from their far left masters. Just like it was in the Soviet Union when I was growing up. Thank you, Gov Youngkin, for having the courage to stand up against the continuing lies and propaganda supported by those who would turn America into a socialist/communist backwater. Next, I suggest you invite the people who oppose this policy to move to one of the existing socialist/communist backwaters, where human rights are trampled and children are abused, and where parents have no say in how their children are raised - there are plenty of them available.  This will bring harm to trans kids. I oppose the discrimination of trans children in school. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. Transgender students are not villains or monsters, so stop treating them as such.

This goes against the basics of mental health support for Trans and LGBTQ youth. Gender affirming care is supported by science and backed by the American Psychological Association.  Can you let the kids be? Politics has no room when it comes to literal children, please, don't drag them in to this. USA, the world is watching you everyday and believe me, they have strong opinions... I am strongly opposed. I fully oppose this. I am strongly opposed. Strongly oppose. This proposal will limit the ability of children to safely develop their identity in a free and fair school environment. It will also serve to damage the mental health of transgender children that prefer names that differ from their name at birth.   Schools are expected to teach reading, writing, math, and thinking skills.  They are not to be ""change agents"" to destroy the civilization that developed them.  In a land of guaranteed freedom of speech and the press, those who wish to exercise these freedoms are being bullied into following the false ""political correctness"" of radicals.  A boy may want to be called a girl, but the speaker should be free to use his own words and call the boy a boy under freedom of speech.  Teachers should not be fired, or students censured for using their words as they see fit.   Bathrooms and locker rooms should reflect the actual nature of the persons involved, not their personally preferred pretend gender.  A physical boy in a girls bathroom or locker room is a real danger, as has already been demonstrated in some schools.  We must return to several thousand years of tradition and sanity.  Hurray for and thanks to Governor Youngkin! There is something particularly insidious about continually stripping children of basic human rights under the guise of keeping parents involved. Their kids should decide whether or not they feel comfortable sharing personal information with their parents, not teachers. A child's gender is, in no way, intertwined with children's educational career. The goal of this policy is obvious and painfully disheartening to see that adults are so willing to open children to potential harm for ideological gain. This will bring harm to trans kids. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. It is a grave mistake to pass this. I strongly oppose Governor Youngkin’s guidelines for schools regarding trans and non-binary students. I urge the board to listen to experts on this matter: the LGBTQ community and their advocacy groups.  This is a terrible policy decision. I oppose this fully. This will bring harm to trans kids. The way this regulation is written will only harm trans kids. The Northam era regulation should be maintained, and this proposed rule should be withdrawn.  It is a grave mistake to pass this. I fully oppose this. This will bring harm to trans kids. I am completely opposed. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. It’s so easy to not be a hateful bigot, maybe give that a shot instead of this trash I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. I fully oppose this. As a parent of a young child who is growing up being taught to respect others and appreciate difference and speak up for themselves, I want to keep my child and others as safe as possible, including giving them autonomy to choose what feels right in their life, not being told who they can be. There are so many issues that should be taking precedence of our state government beyond keeping a kid from using the name and pronouns they want to and being true to themselves. Politicians need to focus on giving more funding to schools, more support for teachers and staff, more resources for learning, more safety from guns and bullying and abuse and  all the ways adults make things harder on children as it is. Make  lives better and freer, not worse. I oppose this guidance and hope the VA DOE will get with the times and keep moving forward and not backwards. Equality and equity and safety and love for all children, no exceptions or conditions! Let them learn and live! Trans and queer kids are just that— kids. By introducing discriminatory and hateful legislation against them, you are inviting violence and sending a clear message that they are seen as somehow less than a whole person and do not deserve basic protections. I strongly oppose legislation that prohibits trans kids from using their chosen name at school and using the bathroom that matches their gender identity. Teachers must be supported and encouraged to treat their students with respect, including using appropriate names and pronouns, or else we are teaching children that disrespecting human life is acceptable and that personal experience is not to be trusted.  I fully oppose this. Strongly oppose. All children deserve to feel safe making choices that help them feel most fully like themselves. I strongly oppose Youngkin’s policy.  I am strongly opposed. This is a terrible policy decision. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. I am completely opposed. I am completely opposed. I am strongly opposed.

Equality and equity and safety and love for all children, no exceptions or conditions! Let them learn and live! Trans and queer kids are just that— kids. By introducing discriminatory and hateful legislation against them, you are inviting violence and sending a clear message that they are seen as somehow less than a whole person and do not deserve basic protections. I strongly oppose legislation that prohibits trans kids from using their chosen name at school and using the bathroom that matches their gender identity. Teachers must be supported and encouraged to treat their students with respect, including using appropriate names and pronouns, or else we are teaching children that disrespecting human life is acceptable and that personal experience is not to be trusted.  I fully oppose this.

I strongly oppose legislation that prohibits trans kids from using their chosen name at school and using the bathroom that matches their gender identity. Teachers must be supported and encouraged to treat their students with respect, including using appropriate names and pronouns, or else we are teaching children that disrespecting human life is acceptable and that personal experience is not to be trusted.  I fully oppose this.

Anonymous ,I demand these new guidelines be implemented in Warren County schools,"Schools are expected to teach reading, writing, math, and thinking skills.  They are not to be ""change agents"" to destroy the civilization that developed them.  In a land of guaranteed freedom of speech and the press, those who wish to exercise these freedoms are being bullied into following the false ""political correctness"" of radicals.  A boy may want to be called a girl, but the speaker should be free to use his own words and call the boy a boy under freedom of speech.  Teachers should not be fired, or students censured for using their words as they see fit.   Bathrooms and locker rooms should reflect the actual nature of the persons involved, not their personally preferred pretend gender.  A physical boy in a girls bathroom or locker room is a real danger, as has already been demonstrated in some schools.  We must return to several thousand years of tradition and sanity.  Hurray for and thanks to Governor Youngkin!",131167,9/26/22  1:25pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131167
Anonymous ,I oppose this policy,"There is something particularly insidious about continually stripping children of basic human rights under the guise of keeping parents involved. Their kids should decide whether or not they feel comfortable sharing personal information with their parents, not teachers. A child's gender is, in no way, intertwined with children's educational career. The goal of this policy is obvious and painfully disheartening to see that adults are so willing to open children to potential harm for ideological gain.",131168,9/26/22  1:25pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131168

Charli Hickam ,Trans rights are human rights ,"This political witch-hunt of the trans community is not without precedent. On 6 May 1933 Adolf Hitler sent his thugs to loot and burn the Institute of Sexology. The medical research was destroyed and the patients were murdered in the holocaust.  this is what politicians do when they have run out of policies to help their nation or theor people. They vilify and kill the marginalized members of y community. Children be damned.  The policies being discussed here are no less extreme. The current nonsense of hospitals forcing children into sexual reassignment surgery is absolutely ridiculous. First of all it already isn’t allowed under WPATH guidelines. But practically speaking even if it was it still does not happen. It is a rare and EXPENSIVE procedure for even adults. With a massive amount of medical gatekeeping besides.   however restricting any and all health care for the trans community is incredibly dangerous. The data on the suicide rates alone should adequately show this. When you compare those numbers to the numbers collected after even socially transitioning (that is to say change of clothes, name, and pronouns) is DRAMATICALLY improved. Like few things in medicine have these success rates. History is clear. Medicine is clear. An attack on the trans community is an evil attempt to deflect from the failures of politicians and it is one of the few true evils in this world. Do not follow in the footsteps of Adolf Hitler. Leave these children alone. ",131207,9/26/22  1:27pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131207

Anonymous ,Liberal Gay Mafia is coordinated attacking this board,"I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. If there's a liberal gay mafia, why are yours the only ones that look like spam I strongly oppose this policy because it harms the mental well-being of trans children and ALL children should be protected! I fully oppose this. Trans kids are children dealing with the most some of the most difficult challenges of becoming an adult. They deserve our unconditional love and support and protection against dehumanizing policies that other them and bully them. Trans individuals have some of the highest rates of suicide in the US and policies like this are part of the reason why. Let's show trans kids how much we LOVE them so they can in turn know it's ok to love themselves too.  this policy is very harmful to trans youth and i do not support it. glen youngkin should be ashamed of himself for trying to put this through. This is a terrible policy decision. Strongly oppose. Do not do this. We need to have our parental rights upheld. This new policy document upholds our rights: ""Parents have the right to make decisions with respect to their children: Policies shall be drafted to safeguard parents’ rights with respect to their child, and to facilitate the exercise of those rights....Schools shall defer to parents to make the best decisions with respect to their children."" I fully oppose this. This new policy is hateful and harmful. Our LGBTQ youth shouldn't be made targets, shouldn't be outted to parents who may harm them, and they shouldn't be made to live in fear, which will happen if Gov Youngkin continues down this dangerous path. LGBTQ students want equal access to education, and they can't have that when they are demonized, called names, and with policies that make it clear they are OTHER THAN!  Asserting parents' rights is asserting parents' right to complete dominion and ability to groom their children in any way they see fit, regardless of how the child feels. If a child of 15 decides they don't want to be Christian and join a religious club of another faith at school, will the school be obliged to ""out"" them to their parents? These proposed policies strip every kid of any autonomy. It strips them of their individualism. It tells every kid that they don't know themselves and certainly can't make decisions for themselves.  My teen has picked which classes they have wanted to take since 9th grade. My teen has chosen what sport to play. My teen will choose what college to attend. By Gov. Youngkin's logic, my teen should have no ability to have that decision-making. It is abhorrent, reckless, and without any science to back it up other than a bunch of zealots who can scream hate under the guise of parental choice. You are not hiding your homophobic, transphobic, and every phobia you have toward anyone that isn't following your same path. I hope every parent screaming about groomers, pedophiles, etc about our schools is blessed to have an LGBTQ child, but sadly that may mean a child out there will be faced with the ultimate betrayal by a parent: to hate their child under the guise of religion. This hate is being driven by nothing but religion. My child's first amendment right means they have an individual right to live their life free from the harm of others. Gov. Youngkin is violating every LGBTQ child under the guise of forcing others to live by his religious convictions. Gov. Youngkin's legacy will be that of a one-term Governor who thought he could force his hate on others. The majority of Americans do not agree with your anti-LGBTQ policies. You are a minority, and if you want schools to teach hate, then do so but don't try and destroy our public schools and defund them under the guise of this unconscionable hate.  This is a terrible policy decision. I am strongly opposed. I am a 29 year old trans woman living in Richmond, VA. I started my transition at the age of 22 but had known about my identity as early as five years old. I grew up in a rural county where I had no idea what being trans meant. Had I understood the concept earlier in my life, I would be facing what this future generation is going to be facing, which is discrimination and ostracization. This is what Youngkin's policy is going to be bringing to children who are simply trying to live their lives without harming anyone in the process. This policy is meant to be a parentals rights policy, but why then if parent's rights are so important that they are not believed when they tell people that their child identifies as trans. Why is it then that a parent's word is also being scrutinized especially in states that are currently banning gender affirming care even with parental consent. It's simple, it is because this isn't about protecting parental rights nor is it about protecting children. If it was about protecting children then these lawmakers would go by the statistics we have regarding decrease in suicidality among trans people when their gender is affirmed and parents, classmates, friends, etc. are supportive. This is and always will be about controlling people. I say this is another step toward genocide because it is another state that is working toward making sure trans people are not shown the same human decency and respect that their peers will receive. It is about making sure these children are seen as different. Youngkin's policy much like other Republican governors, i.e. De Santis, seeks to make sure trans people and their freedoms are slowly taken away to the point that they believe that they can stop people from being trans. They're already in the process of taking away trans people's healthcare, and in Alabama it is a felony for doctor's to prescribe gender affirming care for those under 19 years old. I will say that again, 19 years old. Further explaining that this isn't just about children but an effort to make it so that people are not able to transition at all. These are stepping stones. It is an absolute disgrace knowing that these policies and laws are being made and that they are simply allowed to continue their efforts to take away another human being's right. This policy needs to be stopped.  I am completely opposed. Strongly Support. Its common sense, like gender I oppose this fully. This will bring harm to trans kids. My little sister is in your school system. She has trans friends. When I told her about this guidance document change and what it would mean, she didn’t want to believe it. She denied it. She yelled at me. She made me pull up the document and show her, and then she left the room and sobbed for a good solid hour. For so, so many trans kids, this is going to be horrible. As if discrimination against them wasn’t bad enough already. Do you know how stressful the public school system is? How utterly hostile and inhospitable? Do you know how many times I contemplated suicide, how many times my sister contemplated suicide? Well we’re still here. Despite the public school system. So you’re going to make an already inhospitable environment worse. Bear in mind that my sister and I are not trans. If it was that bad for us, how bad will it be for trans kids whose suicide rates are so much higher? This can, and mark my words will kill trans kids. I know you think you’re helping parents by doing this. I don’t care if you believe being trans is real or not, I don’t care if you think those kids are just confused. But you must consider what the consequences of your actions will be towards those children! Confused or not, school is often the only place they have away from parents who don’t believe or support them. Can you really bring yourself to take that away from them? Parental rights do not trump children’s lives. That’s why CPS exists. Are you ready to accept the moral responsibility of these guideline changes? Are you ready to have these children’s lives on your conscience?  This is a terrible policy decision.

Anonymous ,Liberal Gay Mafia is coordinated attacking this board,"I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. If there's a liberal gay mafia, why are yours the only ones that look like spam I strongly oppose this policy because it harms the mental well-being of trans children and ALL children should be protected! I fully oppose this. Trans kids are children dealing with the most some of the most difficult challenges of becoming an adult. They deserve our unconditional love and support and protection against dehumanizing policies that other them and bully them. Trans individuals have some of the highest rates of suicide in the US and policies like this are part of the reason why. Let's show trans kids how much we LOVE them so they can in turn know it's ok to love themselves too.  this policy is very harmful to trans youth and i do not support it. glen youngkin should be ashamed of himself for trying to put this through. This is a terrible policy decision. Strongly oppose. Do not do this. We need to have our parental rights upheld. This new policy document upholds our rights: ""Parents have the right to make decisions with respect to their children: Policies shall be drafted to safeguard parents’ rights with respect to their child, and to facilitate the exercise of those rights....Schools shall defer to parents to make the best decisions with respect to their children."" I fully oppose this. This new policy is hateful and harmful. Our LGBTQ youth shouldn't be made targets, shouldn't be outted to parents who may harm them, and they shouldn't be made to live in fear, which will happen if Gov Youngkin continues down this dangerous path. LGBTQ students want equal access to education, and they can't have that when they are demonized, called names, and with policies that make it clear they are OTHER THAN!  Asserting parents' rights is asserting parents' right to complete dominion and ability to groom their children in any way they see fit, regardless of how the child feels. If a child of 15 decides they don't want to be Christian and join a religious club of another faith at school, will the school be obliged to ""out"" them to their parents? These proposed policies strip every kid of any autonomy. It strips them of their individualism. It tells every kid that they don't know themselves and certainly can't make decisions for themselves.  My teen has picked which classes they have wanted to take since 9th grade. My teen has chosen what sport to play. My teen will choose what college to attend. By Gov. Youngkin's logic, my teen should have no ability to have that decision-making. It is abhorrent, reckless, and without any science to back it up other than a bunch of zealots who can scream hate under the guise of parental choice. You are not hiding your homophobic, transphobic, and every phobia you have toward anyone that isn't following your same path. I hope every parent screaming about groomers, pedophiles, etc about our schools is blessed to have an LGBTQ child, but sadly that may mean a child out there will be faced with the ultimate betrayal by a parent: to hate their child under the guise of religion. This hate is being driven by nothing but religion. My child's first amendment right means they have an individual right to live their life free from the harm of others. Gov. Youngkin is violating every LGBTQ child under the guise of forcing others to live by his religious convictions. Gov. Youngkin's legacy will be that of a one-term Governor who thought he could force his hate on others. The majority of Americans do not agree with your anti-LGBTQ policies. You are a minority, and if you want schools to teach hate, then do so but don't try and destroy our public schools and defund them under the guise of this unconscionable hate.  This is a terrible policy decision. I am strongly opposed. I am a 29 year old trans woman living in Richmond, VA. I started my transition at the age of 22 but had known about my identity as early as five years old. I grew up in a rural county where I had no idea what being trans meant. Had I understood the concept earlier in my life, I would be facing what this future generation is going to be facing, which is discrimination and ostracization. This is what Youngkin's policy is going to be bringing to children who are simply trying to live their lives without harming anyone in the process. This policy is meant to be a parentals rights policy, but why then if parent's rights are so important that they are not believed when they tell people that their child identifies as trans. Why is it then that a parent's word is also being scrutinized especially in states that are currently banning gender affirming care even with parental consent. It's simple, it is because this isn't about protecting parental rights nor is it about protecting children. If it was about protecting children then these lawmakers would go by the statistics we have regarding decrease in suicidality among trans people when their gender is affirmed and parents, classmates, friends, etc. are supportive. This is and always will be about controlling people.

Anonymous ,Liberal Gay Mafia is coordinated attacking this board,"Trans kids are children dealing with the most some of the most difficult challenges of becoming an adult. They deserve our unconditional love and support and protection against dehumanizing policies that other them and bully them. Trans individuals have some of the highest rates of suicide in the US and policies like this are part of the reason why. Let's show trans kids how much we LOVE them so they can in turn know it's ok to love themselves too.  this policy is very harmful to trans youth and i do not support it. glen youngkin should be ashamed of himself for trying to put this through. This is a terrible policy decision. Strongly oppose. Do not do this. We need to have our parental rights upheld. This new policy document upholds our rights: ""Parents have the right to make decisions with respect to their children: Policies shall be drafted to safeguard parents’ rights with respect to their child, and to facilitate the exercise of those rights....Schools shall defer to parents to make the best decisions with respect to their children."" I fully oppose this. This new policy is hateful and harmful. Our LGBTQ youth shouldn't be made targets, shouldn't be outted to parents who may harm them, and they shouldn't be made to live in fear, which will happen if Gov Youngkin continues down this dangerous path. LGBTQ students want equal access to education, and they can't have that when they are demonized, called names, and with policies that make it clear they are OTHER THAN!  Asserting parents' rights is asserting parents' right to complete dominion and ability to groom their children in any way they see fit, regardless of how the child feels. If a child of 15 decides they don't want to be Christian and join a religious club of another faith at school, will the school be obliged to ""out"" them to their parents? These proposed policies strip every kid of any autonomy. It strips them of their individualism. It tells every kid that they don't know themselves and certainly can't make decisions for themselves.  My teen has picked which classes they have wanted to take since 9th grade. My teen has chosen what sport to play. My teen will choose what college to attend. By Gov. Youngkin's logic, my teen should have no ability to have that decision-making. It is abhorrent, reckless, and without any science to back it up other than a bunch of zealots who can scream hate under the guise of parental choice. You are not hiding your homophobic, transphobic, and every phobia you have toward anyone that isn't following your same path. I hope every parent screaming about groomers, pedophiles, etc about our schools is blessed to have an LGBTQ child, but sadly that may mean a child out there will be faced with the ultimate betrayal by a parent: to hate their child under the guise of religion. This hate is being driven by nothing but religion. My child's first amendment right means they have an individual right to live their life free from the harm of others. Gov. Youngkin is violating every LGBTQ child under the guise of forcing others to live by his religious convictions. Gov. Youngkin's legacy will be that of a one-term Governor who thought he could force his hate on others. The majority of Americans do not agree with your anti-LGBTQ policies. You are a minority, and if you want schools to teach hate, then do so but don't try and destroy our public schools and defund them under the guise of this unconscionable hate.  This is a terrible policy decision. I am strongly opposed. I am a 29 year old trans woman living in Richmond, VA. I started my transition at the age of 22 but had known about my identity as early as five years old. I grew up in a rural county where I had no idea what being trans meant. Had I understood the concept earlier in my life, I would be facing what this future generation is going to be facing, which is discrimination and ostracization. This is what Youngkin's policy is going to be bringing to children who are simply trying to live their lives without harming anyone in the process. This policy is meant to be a parentals rights policy, but why then if parent's rights are so important that they are not believed when they tell people that their child identifies as trans. Why is it then that a parent's word is also being scrutinized especially in states that are currently banning gender affirming care even with parental consent. It's simple, it is because this isn't about protecting parental rights nor is it about protecting children. If it was about protecting children then these lawmakers would go by the statistics we have regarding decrease in suicidality among trans people when their gender is affirmed and parents, classmates, friends, etc. are supportive. This is and always will be about controlling people. I say this is another step toward genocide because it is another state that is working toward making sure trans people are not shown the same human decency and respect that their peers will receive. It is about making sure these children are seen as different. Youngkin's policy much like other Republican governors, i.e. De Santis, seeks to make sure trans people and their freedoms are slowly taken away to the point that they believe that they can stop people from being trans. They're already in the process of taking away trans people's healthcare, and in Alabama it is a felony for doctor's to prescribe gender affirming care for those under 19 years old. I will say that again, 19 years old. Further explaining that this isn't just about children but an effort to make it so that people are not able to transition at all. These are stepping stones. It is an absolute disgrace knowing that these policies and laws are being made and that they are simply allowed to continue their efforts to take away another human being's right. This policy needs to be stopped.  I am completely opposed. Strongly Support. Its common sense, like gender I oppose this fully. This will bring harm to trans kids. My little sister is in your school system. She has trans friends. When I told her about this guidance document change and what it would mean, she didn’t want to believe it. She denied it. She yelled at me. She made me pull up the document and show her, and then she left the room and sobbed for a good solid hour. For so, so many trans kids, this is going to be horrible. As if discrimination against them wasn’t bad enough already. Do you know how stressful the public school system is? How utterly hostile and inhospitable? Do you know how many times I contemplated suicide, how many times my sister contemplated suicide? Well we’re still here. Despite the public school system. So you’re going to make an already inhospitable environment worse. Bear in mind that my sister and I are not trans. If it was that bad for us, how bad will it be for trans kids whose suicide rates are so much higher? This can, and mark my words will kill trans kids. I know you think you’re helping parents by doing this. I don’t care if you believe being trans is real or not, I don’t care if you think those kids are just confused. But you must consider what the consequences of your actions will be towards those children! Confused or not, school is often the only place they have away from parents who don’t believe or support them. Can you really bring yourself to take that away from them? Parental rights do not trump children’s lives. That’s why CPS exists. Are you ready to accept the moral responsibility of these guideline changes?

If it was about protecting children then these lawmakers would go by the statistics we have regarding decrease in suicidality among trans people when their gender is affirmed and parents, classmates, friends, etc. are supportive. This is and always will be about controlling people. I say this is another step toward genocide because it is another state that is working toward making sure trans people are not shown the same human decency and respect that their peers will receive. It is about making sure these children are seen as different. Youngkin's policy much like other Republican governors, i.e. De Santis, seeks to make sure trans people and their freedoms are slowly taken away to the point that they believe that they can stop people from being trans. They're already in the process of taking away trans people's healthcare, and in Alabama it is a felony for doctor's to prescribe gender affirming care for those under 19 years old. I will say that again, 19 years old. Further explaining that this isn't just about children but an effort to make it so that people are not able to transition at all. These are stepping stones. It is an absolute disgrace knowing that these policies and laws are being made and that they are simply allowed to continue their efforts to take away another human being's right. This policy needs to be stopped.  I am completely opposed. Strongly Support. Its common sense, like gender I oppose this fully. This will bring harm to trans kids. My little sister is in your school system. She has trans friends. When I told her about this guidance document change and what it would mean, she didn’t want to believe it. She denied it. She yelled at me. She made me pull up the document and show her, and then she left the room and sobbed for a good solid hour. For so, so many trans kids, this is going to be horrible. As if discrimination against them wasn’t bad enough already. Do you know how stressful the public school system is? How utterly hostile and inhospitable? Do you know how many times I contemplated suicide, how many times my sister contemplated suicide? Well we’re still here. Despite the public school system. So you’re going to make an already inhospitable environment worse. Bear in mind that my sister and I are not trans. If it was that bad for us, how bad will it be for trans kids whose suicide rates are so much higher? This can, and mark my words will kill trans kids. I know you think you’re helping parents by doing this. I don’t care if you believe being trans is real or not, I don’t care if you think those kids are just confused. But you must consider what the consequences of your actions will be towards those children! Confused or not, school is often the only place they have away from parents who don’t believe or support them. Can you really bring yourself to take that away from them? Parental rights do not trump children’s lives. That’s why CPS exists. Are you ready to accept the moral responsibility of these guideline changes? Are you ready to have these children’s lives on your conscience?  This is a terrible policy decision.

Anonymous ,Liberal Gay Mafia is coordinated attacking this board,"Do not do this. We need to have our parental rights upheld. This new policy document upholds our rights: ""Parents have the right to make decisions with respect to their children: Policies shall be drafted to safeguard parents’ rights with respect to their child, and to facilitate the exercise of those rights....Schools shall defer to parents to make the best decisions with respect to their children."" I fully oppose this. This new policy is hateful and harmful. Our LGBTQ youth shouldn't be made targets, shouldn't be outted to parents who may harm them, and they shouldn't be made to live in fear, which will happen if Gov Youngkin continues down this dangerous path. LGBTQ students want equal access to education, and they can't have that when they are demonized, called names, and with policies that make it clear they are OTHER THAN!  Asserting parents' rights is asserting parents' right to complete dominion and ability to groom their children in any way they see fit, regardless of how the child feels. If a child of 15 decides they don't want to be Christian and join a religious club of another faith at school, will the school be obliged to ""out"" them to their parents? These proposed policies strip every kid of any autonomy. It strips them of their individualism. It tells every kid that they don't know themselves and certainly can't make decisions for themselves.  My teen has picked which classes they have wanted to take since 9th grade. My teen has chosen what sport to play. My teen will choose what college to attend. By Gov. Youngkin's logic, my teen should have no ability to have that decision-making. It is abhorrent, reckless, and without any science to back it up other than a bunch of zealots who can scream hate under the guise of parental choice. You are not hiding your homophobic, transphobic, and every phobia you have toward anyone that isn't following your same path. I hope every parent screaming about groomers, pedophiles, etc about our schools is blessed to have an LGBTQ child, but sadly that may mean a child out there will be faced with the ultimate betrayal by a parent: to hate their child under the guise of religion. This hate is being driven by nothing but religion. My child's first amendment right means they have an individual right to live their life free from the harm of others. Gov. Youngkin is violating every LGBTQ child under the guise of forcing others to live by his religious convictions. Gov. Youngkin's legacy will be that of a one-term Governor who thought he could force his hate on others. The majority of Americans do not agree with your anti-LGBTQ policies. You are a minority, and if you want schools to teach hate, then do so but don't try and destroy our public schools and defund them under the guise of this unconscionable hate.  This is a terrible policy decision. I am strongly opposed. I am a 29 year old trans woman living in Richmond, VA. I started my transition at the age of 22 but had known about my identity as early as five years old. I grew up in a rural county where I had no idea what being trans meant. Had I understood the concept earlier in my life, I would be facing what this future generation is going to be facing, which is discrimination and ostracization. This is what Youngkin's policy is going to be bringing to children who are simply trying to live their lives without harming anyone in the process. This policy is meant to be a parentals rights policy, but why then if parent's rights are so important that they are not believed when they tell people that their child identifies as trans.

Put the blood libel down and listen to the children themselves before you lose the ones you love. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. It is a grave mistake to pass this. We need to honor and love our trans children, not shame them and castigate them. They should be called by their preferred names and pronouns. They should have adequate bathroom facilities that match their gender, not their biological sex. They should not fear being outed to abusive or unsupportive parents (I realize most parents are not abusive or unsupportive, but such parents do exist and schools should protect them from such parents). They should be loved, respected, and cared for by their teachers and school officials. I oppose this fully. I am strongly opposed and deeply troubled by the proposed changes. As a United Methodist pastor, I remember several confidential conversations with LGBTQ youth and young adults who were claiming their identity and were terrified of the reaction of their parents if they learned who these young people truly were. There home would not be a safe space for them; for the public school system to systematically and intentionally ""out"" a student is dangerous and poses significant risk to their well-being. Not every parent is the ""Donna Reed"" parent Gov. Youngkin assumes is the case for all our students. There are many reasons for LGBTQ students to be tempted to suicide; parental intimidation and rejection is one of them. It seems to me that the proposed guidelines cannot effectively meet the commitment to letting parents have final say over all things related to the children and the commitment to the well-being of all students. I confess I am not hopeful, given the Governor's  seeming commitment to a political base more than to genuine needs and sound science, I sincerely hope and pray these proposed guidelines will not be confirmed. I support Gov. Youngkin and strongly support parents rights in the education of their children. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. Do not do this. Many adults struggle with mental health crises because of the inability to express their true identity in a safe and accepting space as children. There is so much research about how trying to suppress children's identity leads to depression, anxiety, and life being taken too soon. School is already a battlefield for many who do not fit cleanly into societal standards. LGBTQ+ children deserve the same safety and agency that all children deserve. I believe that Youngkin's policies are a step backwards and will lead to much unnecessary pain and suffering and I fully oppose them.  It is a grave mistake to pass this.

This law prohibits discrimination in public and private employment, credit, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among other additional protected categories.

This entire policy is likely built up on a, pardon my French,  rhetoric that transphobic people use to further their disgusting and incorrect ideology. If you really wanted to help trans kids, you wouldn't force them to come out to their parents, especially when those parents can turn around and become abusive towards their kids for such things! Shame on you! Take your violation of rights and get it out of this state and its schooling system. I oppose this fully. I oppose this fully. Just because you do not understand the experience of transgender individuals does not give you the right to treat them as anything less than full humans with every right you have. Educate yourselves, and stop being bigots. This will bring harm to trans kids. Do not do this. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. If you oppose this you oppose parental rights I am completely opposed. I appreciate you giving parents control but the public school system is broken. After seeing the fluff they are teaching I kept my child out of public school. There's not enough teachers or teacher's aids. No subs for anything. They are forcing teachers out and replacing them with people they can control. History is a joke. We need to dismantle the DOE and start teaching real History and math and science. Not this nonsense they're trying to pass off as education This bill gravely impacts the freedom of humans to express themselves and their gender safely. It is imperative to a free society that we support bodily autonomy for all. Anyone who wishes to pursue happiness should be free to do so, especially within the limits of their body and choices. It is the right of life that ensures the necessity of liberty, and nowhere is liberty more sacred than in the relationship of a person with their body and how they carry it in the world. I oppose this in the strongest possible manor. I oppose this fully. I oppose this fully. This will bring harm to trans kids. Strongly Oppose This is a terrible policy decision. this law does nothing but impose neddless cruelty apon the children of Virginia  This is a terrible policy decision. I write to stand against Governor Youngkin's transphobic policies. Governor Youngkin's policies are rooted in transphobia and only seek to further harm trans and non-binary kids. They create a hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for those same students as they require teachers and staff to forcibly out students to their parents against the student’s will.  Youngkin’s policies would prohibit educators from using students’ affirming names and pronouns to help support their students and their mental health. Putting trans students further into harm's way, they also force the students into a bathroom and sports policy that do not adhere to their true gender identity, making them potential targets for bullying, abuse, and violence.Governor Youngkin’s policies also explicitly contradict state law and are illegal. In 2021, Governor Ralph Northam signed the Virginia Values Act into law after it was passed through the General Assembly. This law prohibits discrimination in public and private employment, credit, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among other additional protected categories. The protections in this act have been extended to protect LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia public schools throughout the Commonwealth to prohibit discrimination, harassment, and violence in against these students.I cannot stand for these policies to be illegally forced upon Virginia's students in the name of the Republican Party's so-called “parent’s rights” campaign against kids. We need to protect trans kids, and these policies only seek to harm and further marginalize LGBTQ+ people.Thank you. Respectfully,Colleen MooreArlington, VA Inhumane law, should be ashamed. Apparently government is a OK stepping on people's rights but Republicans and governor want less government oversight. What a bunch of horse . I fully oppose this. This policy is designed to harm trans children. It is not in the interest of students. This is a terrible policy decision. Do not do this. This isn’t about parents it’s about a child as a person in their own right and an individual.  They have rights too, including to their is. Thoughts and sense of self.  We have no right to take that from them and focus on parents instead. If a child felt comfortable telling their parent, they would!  And we can help them get to that point, but somethings that is not an option. Stop endangering our lgbtq youth! This will bring harm to trans kids. This will bring harm to trans kids.",131403,9/26/22  1:34pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131403

This law prohibits discrimination in public and private employment, credit, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among other additional protected categories. The protections in this act have been extended to protect LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia public schools throughout the Commonwealth to prohibit discrimination, harassment, and violence in against these students.I cannot stand for these policies to be illegally forced upon Virginia's students in the name of the Republican Party's so-called “parent’s rights” campaign against kids. We need to protect trans kids, and these policies only seek to harm and further marginalize LGBTQ+ people.Thank you. Respectfully,Colleen MooreArlington, VA Inhumane law, should be ashamed. Apparently government is a OK stepping on people's rights but Republicans and governor want less government oversight. What a bunch of horse . I fully oppose this. This policy is designed to harm trans children. It is not in the interest of students. This is a terrible policy decision. Do not do this. This isn’t about parents it’s about a child as a person in their own right and an individual.  They have rights too, including to their is. Thoughts and sense of self.  We have no right to take that from them and focus on parents instead. If a child felt comfortable telling their parent, they would!  And we can help them get to that point, but somethings that is not an option. Stop endangering our lgbtq youth!

If you're so mindful of constitutional protection, why are you adopting a policy that targets the privacy that all LGBT+ members of society are rightfully allowed, given that the dangers of revealing themselves (of which include hate crimes and murder)? Why is this policy even being considered in the first place? Parents only have the right to know whether or not a child will attempt to harm themselves or others, OR if their family members or someone they know will attempt those things. This doesn't apply to transgender individuals whatsoever, because being transgender doesn't make one prone to self-harm. Self-harm is linked to mental distress, not the type of gender one is. This entire policy is likely built up on a, pardon my French,  rhetoric that transphobic people use to further their disgusting and incorrect ideology.

If you oppose this you oppose parental rights I am completely opposed. I appreciate you giving parents control but the public school system is broken.

Anonymous ,public school ,I appreciate you giving parents control but the public school system is broken. After seeing the fluff they are teaching I kept my child out of public school. There's not enough teachers or teacher's aids. No subs for anything. They are forcing teachers out and replacing them with people they can control. History is a joke. We need to dismantle the DOE and start teaching real History and math and science.

Saielle DaSilva ,Strongly opposed to new regulations,"This bill gravely impacts the freedom of humans to express themselves and their gender safely. It is imperative to a free society that we support bodily autonomy for all. Anyone who wishes to pursue happiness should be free to do so, especially within the limits of their body and choices.

Colleen Moore ,I reject Gov Youngkin's anti-trans policies,"I write to stand against Governor Youngkin's transphobic policies. Governor Youngkin's policies are rooted in transphobia and only seek to further harm trans and non-binary kids. They create a hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for those same students as they require teachers and staff to forcibly out students to their parents against the student’s will.  Youngkin’s policies would prohibit educators from using students’ affirming names and pronouns to help support their students and their mental health. Putting trans students further into harm's way, they also force the students into a bathroom and sports policy that do not adhere to their true gender identity, making them potential targets for bullying, abuse, and violence.Governor Youngkin’s policies also explicitly contradict state law and are illegal. In 2021, Governor Ralph Northam signed the Virginia Values Act into law after it was passed through the General Assembly. This law prohibits discrimination in public and private employment, credit, housing, and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among other additional protected categories. The protections in this act have been extended to protect LGBTQ+ youth in Virginia public schools throughout the Commonwealth to prohibit discrimination, harassment, and violence in against these students.I cannot stand for these policies to be illegally forced upon Virginia's students in the name of the Republican Party's so-called “parent’s rights” campaign against kids. We need to protect trans kids, and these policies only seek to harm and further marginalize LGBTQ+ people.Thank you.

Matthew Brown ,Strongly opposed. This is not about protecting Virginia students. It is about harming them.,"I graduated from the College of William and Mary in 2019 and received a Master’s in Counseling form William & Mary in 2021. I currently work as resident counselor at a private mental health counseling practice.  Governor Youngkin’s policy on transgender students claims to be about protecting students, but there is no evidence that any student will be protected by these laws. The agreed upon treatment of a child experiencing gender dysphoria is allowing them to social transition via wearing gender affirming clothing and going by a name which makes them feel comfortable. Preventing this in a school setting where dramatically increases the risk of suicide among transgender students. Furthermore, allowing social transitioning poses no threat to the student transitioning or their classmates. Fear-mongering about male students pretending to be trans to sneak into girls bathrooms/locker rooms are entirely a media fabrication. In reality, trans students are overwhelmingly more likely to be the victims of violence than to be the perpetrators, and to pretend otherwise is to be willfully ignorant. Furthermore there is strong evidence that these laws directly lead to bullying, violence, and discrimination against not only transgender students, but also any cisgender student who (by their own choice or not) do not strictly conform to gender stereotypes. For example, there are many cases of cisgender girls who have been barred from playing school sports because they naturally appear more masculine. Also, these policies would give teachers license to shame and harass any student who they believed was not behaving in a way that they felt aligns with the gender they were assigned at birth. If these policies go into affects, many Virginia students will face immense harm, and many trans students will be pushed to suicide.  Governor Youngkin is of course aware of all of these facts. He knows that by making these laws, he will be making Virginia schools demonstrably less safe for any student who does not fit in with their peers. He knows it will lead many transgender students to kill themselves or drop out, or simply suffer silently. That is the reason he is suggesting it. Governor Youngkin would rather see hundreds of children dead than accept that some children are different from others, and that those different children are worthy of life. He and his GOP allies wish nothing more than the eradication of transgender and gay people, and they do not care who gets caught in the crossfire.",131530,9/26/22  1:39pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131530

Kourtney- NBCT Virginia Educator ,Harming children under the guise of parental rights,"As an educator, a parent, an aunt and a HUMAN BEING, I strongly oppose this bill that puts children at direct risk for harassment, ridicule, and their own safety. Schools are supposed to be a safe haven for students that may not have support at home. Schools are places of learning- and if we can’t learn from one another, then what are we doing? Schools are places where we can either support ALL students, or we can make it a place where some students are reported- like the gestapo. This teacher refuses to report and will continue to honor a student’s chosen identity and teach others that the differences in each of us is what learning and understanding is all about.  Don’t be fooled- this isn’t about a parent’s rights. It’s about harming the children that are already at the highest risk for suicide. Parents have plenty of rights- remember you have the right to send your child to a school that will choose to discriminate. But public schools accept everyone and treat everyone with the same respect they deserve. At least they used to be. I have hope they will continue to be. ",131535,9/26/22  1:39pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131535

As such all provisions such as: referring to pupils by their chosen name and pronouns,  allowing students to use space reserved for a specific gender/sex as match their gender identity, protection from harassment or bullying by adults or children (especially hostile parents), etc must be upheld.

While I agree that is a fundamental due process right under the 14th Amendment, such rights (or ANY rights) should never be at the expense of the fundamental rights of another.  A parent's rights to censor what their child learns at school does not trump a child's right to a safe, inclusive, free public education.  FULL STOP. Moreover, parents are given a say in public education by electing local officials, school boards, school committee members, etc.  That is the end of a parent's right to direct what is taught in schools - as it should be.  Public education is just that.  If parents want more input on their child's education, perhaps they should consider home schooling or private schooling.  All children in the Commonwealth of Virginia should be afforded a safe, welcoming learning environment - one inclusive of all children.  Virginia is better than this.

Nathaniel Green ,This is a horrific policy,"I oppose this proposed policy in the strongest possible terms. This would strip trans and gender fluid students of the protections they currently have in our public schools. It is also an attack on Virginia's educators. For far too many trans and gender fluid students, school is a sanctuary, a place where they have more protections and who they are is affirmed to a greater degree than any place else, even at home. Parents who love and accept their children for who they are support the protections that are currently in place: protections that include allowing trans students to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, rather than their biological sex. Protections also exist currently for trans gender pronouns and names. Teachers in Arlington Public Schools are directed to make sure they refer to a student by the name and pronoun they want to be called. No consultation or deferral to parents is required, or necessary. This is as it should be. These policies would take those protections away.  The policy in question is here: https://doe.virginia.gov/support/gender-diversity/2022-model-policies-on-the-privacy-dignity-and-respect-for-all-students-town-hall.pdf",,9/26/22  1:42pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131592

Public schools, however, are for ALL, and every single student MUST feel safe and affirmed while at school even gender diverse kids. Kids who don't feel safe are not ready to learn and, for a Governor so obsessed with our supposedly failing public schools, he sure is picking a strange and ineffective way to address ""learning loss.""  These model policies are a blatant violation of the Virginia Human Rights Act and § 22.1-23.3 of the Code of Virginia AND disregard the ruling by the 4th Circuit Court in Grimm v.

Making a hostile education environment will do nothing but harm and cause long lasting damage to these children.

That MUST be the only kids it aims to protect, because the actual policies it contains would do real harm to trans and non-binary kids. Allowing kids to be dead-named every single day will cause immense psychological damage. There’s already an epidemic of mental health issues and suicide amongst trans and non-binary youth. This policy would exacerbate that. In addition, teaching kids that they can harm others in the name of religion is absolutely despicable - and I say that as a practicing Christian.

Barry Stern ,Agree w Governor's proposal - yet propose course for teens on dealing w controversial social issues ,"Controversial social health issues course.  Schools, colleges, churches, businesses, etc. provide a valuable service when they encourage people to educate themselves about people who are different. But you don’t improve intergroup relations by making certain groups wrong, as many are prone to do in this age of political correctness and divisiveness, CRT being today’s most evident example. Moreover, one-off anti-bias or sensitivity trainings like Starbucks offers has little lasting value as research has shown, even though these might help disingenuous white business owners feel better and perhaps enhance their bottom line. Rather than offer anti-bias training apart from other controversial social health issues, help people discover and deal with the various biases that make us human through well-crafted, voluntary courses of study that address several of a community’s hot social health issues. We have no lack of these: § Bullying § Opioid/drug abuse § School shootings and disciplinary incidents § Mental health breakdowns § Teen suicides § Sexual misconduct § Interracial strife § Homelessness § Deteriorating police-youth relations § Assimilating recent immigrants, § Urban riots destroying and looting property, just to name a few. Keeping such issues in their disciplinary silos through separate programs to address every problem is neither engaging, effective nor affordable. Much as the work of organizations that address these issues is admirable, their highly targeted responses tend not to provide sufficient time and subject matter breadth for the in-depth training in emotional intelligence that today’s world requires. In a word, our communities must build better people to deal with this evermore complex world, and that requires opportunities over time to practice building healthy relationships in continually shifting situations. Such a course, probably team taught, would seem as important as any other. Students, and for that matter most Americans, need courses, retreats and town meetings that would help them develop and defend points of view on controversial social health issues and listen carefully and respectfully to one another while they argue. I largely developed and taught such a course at Berkeley High School (CA) that remained in the curriculum for over 25 years (links below). Race relations was among the topics that a student class could choose to cover in the course’s 50 hours; however, the issue of race often came up in discussing and debating other topics, such as drug abuse, police-youth relations and human sexuality. Backing into such discussions involving race was just as if not more effective than a unitary focus on it. One of my successors wrote a book about her experiences with this “social living” course. The State of Virginia could fund the updating of this course with the help of prominent health and social service organizations and offer the associated teacher training package to schools, colleges and community organizations that would like to run with it. The state should also design and fund a long-term evaluation through the competitive bid process. http://loudounnow.com/2016/07/22/op-ed-engaging-teens-to-confront-social-and-health-challenges/ http://loudounnow.com/2018/04/18/letter-barry-e-stern-purcellville/",,9/26/22  1:43pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131612

Pim Coremans ,This proposal is a breach of fundamental human rights,"This proposal made by Glen Youngkin is filled with all kind of weasel words and political jargon to hide it's true intention. Namely to strip transgender kids of their rights and to deprive of them of a safe environment where they can express themselves. By implementing this proposal it would turn schools from a safe haven into a prison like environment where one is punished for not conforming to the gender norm one was given by their parents. I respect that parent's have a right to educate their children in the way that they see fit, however this right should not hinder a child's development into the person they want to grow up to be. This proposal would give the Virginian government and Virginian schools the legal possibilities to publicly out transgender children and to ban them from using the school's utilities(bathrooms etc) in a way that conforms with their gender identity. If implemented it will lead to situations where transgender kids may find themselves threatened with their lives, either via their classmates or hostile school stuff or via their parents who object to their gender identity. It would lead to systematic discrimination of the state and private actors against transgender children and will costs the lives of many of them. The proposal tries to justify itself by using phrases like ""Freedom of the parents to educate their child"" and ""consultation with educational leaders"". However if implemented this will reduce the freedom of a large group of people. If Glen Youngkin and the Republican party really cared about freedom as much as they claim they do then they would recognize this and not come with proposals like this. Reality however proves otherwise which shows to the world that they do not care about freedom but rather about control. Control of transgender children and of transgender people in general. Furthermore if implemented could this policy have repercussions far beyond the state of Virginia. It could lead to implementation of similar policies in other US states and beyond and it would affect far more people then imagined. I urge everyone reading my comment to resist this proposal by blocking efforts to further legislation like this. This can be done via protests, strikes or by spreading the news and denouncing it far and wide. We cannot allow a small group of people like this to determine the faith of thousands if not millions of people.

Anonymous ,I support trans kids but want parents involved.,"I am a liberal person who believes that trans kids need to be supported and not bullied, I have been through these discussions and explorations with my own kids and feel intimately involved in what these feelings and impulses look like in pre-teens.  I also believe fully that there are elements of social contagion that is driving the current tidal-wave of self-identified trans kids. It is because I have thought so much about this that I believe that the original policy which not only allowed, but encouraged schools to keep parents out of these discussions and decisions around gender was deeply wrong and destructive.   I do not support all of the elements of the Governor's new policy (I could not care less about bathrooms), and I did not vote for him.  However, I was relieved that the new policy brought parents role back to the forefront, which is essential.  I would suggest that maybe there be provision to provide a work-around for instances when the school believes that abuse or real harm may occur because of parental involvement.  It could be a court or psychologist approved system that gives schools flexibility, but is more than just a pre-teen asking to hide something from their parents, which should never be the position of the government to encourage or facilitate.  Thank you for this policy change.  I am relieved and grateful.",131627,9/26/22  1:43pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131627

Lynn Ellen Queen ,This will hurt children. They deserve better from us.,"Another citizen of the Commonwealth captured my thoughts exactly: ""The 2021 policy enacted by the Department of Education created guidance to school boards and schools that protected trans and non-binary youth and provided an inclusionary learning environment for all students – exactly the role of public schools in our nation. This new proposed policy takes away protections that kids had to be free from harm in their learning environment, imposing standards that put them in danger in school and for some, at home. I urge the Board to reject this new policy and maintain the 2021 inclusive policy.  Schools are to act in the best interest of the child and protect children while in their care. We train educators to identify bullying behavior and signs of abuse in the home and the steps they can take to intervene. By forcing an educator to use ""birth assigned sex"" when determining names and pronouns of children and teens instead of respecting the student, this policy will out trans students who are socially transitioned but, for whatever reason, have not gone through the process to make legal changes, increasing their risk of assault and bullying. For some trans and non-binary students, school is the only safe space in their life and the educators they interact with who are respectful of them are the key protective factor that leads to survival. This policy will take that away from at-risk youth.  If this policy is enacted, suicides in LGBTQ+ youth, especially trans youth will increase. Bullying of these same youth will increase. Targeted attacks of these same youth will increase. These are hyperbolic statements, but facts based on data from organizations like the CDC, who recommend that schools provide safe spaces for all youth, especially LGBTQ+ youth to reduce teen suicides. A 2019 NIH study documented that real and perceived safety at school is a protective factor for trans students in reducing suicidal tendencies."" I ask you to prioritize the needs of children over the feelings of a few people with limited understanding of trans people and over the political aspirations of Governor Youngkin. Prioritize saving children and keeping schools safe for every child, regardless of anyone's personal belief system.

You state that a child's ""distinctive abilities and characteristics... should be valued and respected"", and that all children, including transgender children, have the right to attend school ""in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying"". Yet somehow, this proposal immediately turns against these promises, demanding teachers and faculty deadname & use the wrong pronouns for transgender students, & report any deviations from traditional gender identity to parents that could very well harass & punish their child for feelings they cannot control. Rules like these do not discourage children from making a decision they'll regret, as some have suggested about trans children changing their name & gender presentation & taking hormone therapies; in fact, nearly 95% of trans individuals who undergo these procedures are extremely satisfied & do not regret their decision, regardless of age. All these policies do is make transgender kids less comfortable in a school environment & in their own bodies, and open up abuse by peers, teachers, & the very same parents you claim have an inalienable right to control their children's lives. This rule is highly unethical & does not respect the biological, psychological, and social realities of transgender students, and as a very concerned citizen I insist that you refuse its passage.",131648,9/26/22  1:44pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131648

Anonymous ,A Vague & Harmful Policy That'll Harm Cisgender Students as Much a Trans Students,"These policies are so harmful & vague in how they limit the rights of children. Not even the rights of gender expression. The right to a child's very imagination. Are we supposed to tell elementary schoolers that they can't play around with creative nicknames? That a child named Edward can't be affectionately called Squidward by his friends, simply because it's not commonly associated with the legal name? What does ""commonly associated"" even mean? What guide are they going based off of for this? They don't provide one! And how is it legal to say that a student's legal name and sex may not be changed? That's in direct violation of state laws! Are they trying to bankrupt Virginia schools with future court costs? Shouldn't this be left to the state lawmakers, so it doesn't invite legal conflict and opposition that could only reinforce the policies these new policies are replacing? And what are they doing trying to place ""trans-girls"" with cisgender boys, and vice-versa? Are they encouraging illicit activities between students of opposite gender identities? These rules are just as barbaric, if not more so, for cisgender students to adhere to as transgender students & should be immediately recalled & reconsidered!",131669,9/26/22  1:45pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131669

Rebecca Ramsey ,Let Trans Kids Live!,"These proposed 'regulations' are a horrific and monstrous attack on the right of transgender kids to simply be who they are, on their fundamental right to bodily autonomy and self-determination. Children are not the property of their parents, or of the state. They have the right to decide who they will be and to demand that we respect their choices. There is nothing wrong with being transgender--it is a normal and healthy part of human diversity. Transgender people have existed since the dawn of human civilization (and no doubt long before that) and will exist for epochs after our own civilization dwindles into dust. You cannot stamp gender diversity out by simply refusing to treat transgender people with basic human decency. All these regulations will do is cause harm to vulnerable young people who are just trying to live authentic lives as the people who they truly are. The regulations will inflict incredible pain and suffering on young people (pain and suffering which, if you are not trans yourselves, you cannot possibly begin to comprehend), which studies have shown can lead to lifelong mental illness, physical harm, and even death. These regulations are also against Virginia law as it concerns gender identity and equality in education. The governor's administration is attempting to circumvent the law to hurt vulnerable young people via administrative action, a truly heinous and illegal abuse of power. It will fail in the courts, but it should never be allowed to stand in the first place.",131672,9/26/22  1:45pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131672

In spite of the good fortune and privileges life has given me, my time in grade school was a difficult one, primarily because of direct and indirect harassments from other students. I cannot imagine how much more difficult it is for LGBTQ students trying to go through school, knowing that both their peers AND the education system (and by extent the government) would enforce a policy that would coerce them to either conform to  christo-conservative desires, or expel them from sight and mind. This policy and its enforcement condemns LGBTQ, as if their existence is something to be shunned, by providing zero recourse for any harassment or harmful actions against them. Further, it endangers the students in question by forcing staff to ""out"" them to their parents or guardians, who themselves may be violently bigoted towards LGBTQ; The policymakers and enforcers pretend their hands are clean from any harm that comes to the students. Do not pass this policy. I want the younger generations to become smarter and kinder, to feel safe that they can talk about who they are and that they can have some confidence that they'll be able to grow up and grow old; this policy confirms neither.",131680,9/26/22  1:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131680

This policy is yet another detestable effort to engage in LGBTQ+ erasure in our schools by forcing LGBTQ+ students, transgender students in particular to hide and/or deny their identities for fear that their teachers and school staff will be forced to ""out"" them to their parents, which will lead to verbal, emotional, and/or physical abuse and/or being kicked out of their homes. It is also designed to scare teachers and school staff to do the bidding of the ""Moms For Liberty"" crowd. This policy, which was likely heavily influenced by right-wing special interests is intentionally cruel, and has no place in a Commonwealth which slogan is ""Virginia is for Lovers"" in reference to the Loving v Virginia case that ended bans on interracial marriage. If this awful policy is enacted it will be resisted by some of the largest school districts in the Commonwealth and rightfully so, and as a teacher of 17 years, I have no intention of supporting it.",131688,9/26/22  1:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131688

My school wasn’t kind to trans kids; teachers outed students to their families, kids bullied lgbt students without consequence, it wasn’t an option to change our name or participate in events/use facilities that were separated by gender- basically the environment  that these guidelines would call for. Because of this, and already facing bullying for being a queer POC, I didn’t come out as transgender until well into adulthood. My educational environment being so openly transphobic made me ashamed to be trans and I suppressed my gender identity for a long time. This of course had a negative impact on my mental health and cost me years of my life I will never get back. I often think about how different things could have been if as a teenager I had access to life changing and life saving policies that protect and support trans and non-binary youth. For example, I would have been more comfortable making friends, would have focused better in class and spent less time worrying and trying to suppress a key part of who I am, I would have joined a sports team, and I would have started college confidently and authentically my full self.  All kids should have the opportunity for a complete childhood where they are supported by their teachers and peers, and can explore who they are in a safe and loving environment. My heart breaks for the trans and non-binary youth who’s lives are being used as a political pawn. This administration is signaling to the most vulnerable population that they do not matter and aren’t to be trusted, no kid should be made to feel that way.  Attacking queer youth and education is going to come back to bite the Republican Party in a few short years when these newly politicized teenagers reach voting age.",131747,9/26/22  1:49pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131747
Andrew Shelton ,Bodily autonomy is a human right.,"It is beyond debate that the right to do with ones body as they will is among the core and essential human rights afforded to us by our very existence as human beings, but if we must cite a document like the constitution instead we may. We are to be secure in our own persons, and that includes issues of bodily appearance and issues of identity. Many of the proponents for outing trans youth cite a vested interest of the parents, but we cannot treat all parents as equals in regards to safety or love. One needs only to give a passing glance to the treatment experienced by most of the LGBTQ+ community to realize the harm it could cause many children and teenagers to be outed to their abusive parent/parents. The choice to discuss such matters, or anything else, should be left to those most directly effected by that choice; and that is not the parent.",131748,9/26/22  1:49pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131748

Plus, some kids may not want other children (i. e. bullies) to know about them being trans and having a different name.  Allow these kids to be called what they want by the few people in their lives who may be able to make them feel safe and valid, don’t take this away from them, please.",131771,9/26/22  1:50pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131771

Maria ,"Strongly Oppose, Let Us Be Kind","I cannot believe that kindness is now a radical, rebellious act. A teacher simply calling their student by their proper name which they identify with, is an act of kindness, not a political standpoint. What is the difference between a student who was named Christopher at birth asking to be called Chris and a student who was named Hannah at birth asking to be called Preston? I am currently a student at James Madison University's College of Education and this proposed policy has been a recurring topic in my education classes. During class discussion, it has been made clear that all of my classmates oppose this policy. And speaking for myself, when I am a teacher, no matter the outcome of this policy, I will be calling my students exactly what they want to be called, no matter what is on their birth certificate. No matter if I lose my job. Why are we, as a country, demonizing kindness?

Anonymous ,Liberal Gay Mafia is coordinated attacking this board,"Guidance Document Change: Every day, throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia, educators and school leaders work to ensure that all students have an opportunity to receive a high-quality education. As a part of that work, educators strive to meet the individual needs of all students entrusted to their care, and teachers work to create educational environments where all students thrive. The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students. The Department also fully acknowledges the rights of parents to exercise their fundamental rights granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children. The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents to determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is essential to improving outcomes for all children in Virginia. The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological belief. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or religious beliefs. The Department embarked on a thorough review of the Model Policies Guidance adopted on March 4, 2021 (the “2021 Model Policies”). The 2021 Model Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools. The 2021 Model Policies also disregarded the rights of parents and ignored other legal and constitutional principles that significantly impact how schools educate students, including transgender students. With the publication of these 2022 Model Policies (the “2022 Model Policies”), the Department hereby withdraws the 2021 Model Policies, which shall have no further force and effect. The Department issues the 2022 Model Policies to provide clear, accurate, and useful guidance to Virginia school boards that align with statutory provisions governing the Model Policies. See Code of Virginia, § 22.1-23.3 (the “Act”). Significantly, the 2022 Model Policies also consider over 9,000 comments submitted to the Department during the public comment period for the 2021 Model Policies.",131819,9/26/22  1:52pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131819

As a part of that work, educators strive to meet the individual needs of all students entrusted to their care, and teachers work to create educational environments where all students thrive. The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students. The Department also fully acknowledges the rights of parents to exercise their fundamental rights granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children. The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents to determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is essential to improving outcomes for all children in Virginia. The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological belief. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or religious beliefs. The Department embarked on a thorough review of the Model Policies Guidance adopted on March 4, 2021 (the “2021 Model Policies”). The 2021 Model Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools. The 2021 Model Policies also disregarded the rights of parents and ignored other legal and constitutional principles that significantly impact how schools educate students, including transgender students. With the publication of these 2022 Model Policies (the “2022 Model Policies”), the Department hereby withdraws the 2021 Model Policies, which shall have no further force and effect. The Department issues the 2022 Model Policies to provide clear, accurate, and useful guidance to Virginia school boards that align with statutory provisions governing the Model Policies. See Code of Virginia, § 22.1-23.3 (the “Act”). Significantly, the 2022 Model Policies also consider over 9,000 comments submitted to the Department during the public comment period for the 2021 Model Policies.",131830,9/26/22  1:53pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131830

"Barbara, grandmother raising a grandchild ",Stronly Approve!,"I am thankful that you have given parents their right to control what their children learn. Our kids deserve to be educated not groomed. However, the whole public education system needs a total overhaul! Why are teachers being pushed out and cannot find subs or have teachers aides? Why are public schools teaching fluff instead of true history?? Our public education system is failing our children! They cannot read or write. My granddaughter was so far ahead of her class and after seeing what they are teaching, I pulled her out of public school. I am on a fixed income and have sacrificed everything so she will have the BEST education and that definitely doesn't come from public school. Schools are shortstaffed and are in big trouble in SW Virginia.

Guin ,I categorically oppose this. ,"These proposed changes to the Virginia DOE policies will endanger trans youth and all other students. They are internally inconsistent and blatantly discriminatory. I oppose all elements of this proposal. Trans students should not be forcibly outed to anyone they do not wish to be out to. Some kids may lose housing as a result of being forcibly outed. Trans students should not have to endure even more in the endless barrage of being misgendered in their lives. School is a place to learn. Let trans kids learn in peace. Their lives are already hard enough and school may be one of the few places they can achieve success or peace - do not rob them of it. The overwhelming majority of data shows unambiguously that supporting and affirming trans kids (using their correct pronouns i.e. the ones they choose, allowing them to see positive representations of trans people, access to affirming medical treatment such as counseling and hormones as the standard practice with all patients as determined by doctors etc) is strongly correlated with better mental health outcomes. This means decreased depression, increased happiness, and critically a drop in suicidality. As a population extremely vulnerable to harassment, discrimination, and outright violence - trans kids and people need as much protection as possible. Any amount of research will show that what I say here is true. If you are reading this you are probably an adult who knows how to use a library or at the very least google scholar. Go and find what prestigious medical associations say about protecting trans people. Seriously, go and find out yourself. read through the data and learn that we are normal people who need to be supported not attacked.    If you do not explicitly work to defend marginalized children, then you have no honor. If the Virginia BOE decides to go through with this proposal and explicitly discriminate against marginalized children then it is not an institution that deserves respect or regard. If you adopt this proposal, children will die. The people of Virginia demand that you stop politicizing the lives of marginalized children and let them learn in peace. Halt this proposal immediately. ",131842,9/26/22  1:53pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131842

Anonymous ,This is psychologically harmful to children to discriminate like this,"I am a mental health counselor in Virginia and I can easily say that this policy will make children feel unsafe and make it more difficult for them to ask for help for mental health issues. It will open up schools to increased lawsuits when it inevitably leads to increased suicides, bullying, and general discrimination by the schools against students. ",131846,9/26/22  1:53pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131846
Alexa Whitlock ,Trans Kids Matter! ,"I am a teacher in Northern Virginia and I have many trans and non-binary students. These proposed policies are detrimental to the mental health and overall well-being of these students. The policies are clearly not meant to provide support to families who do have trans/non-binary students or else it would be easier for families to change student pronouns or names for schools.  Requiring the legal documents provides undue burden on supporting families. This pilicy just alianiates children who already do not feel supported by society. Additionally, should I not call any Jonathan's John without permission? Bobby and Robbie instead of Robert? This also provides more burden on teachers who are already overwhelmed, overworked, and undersupported. ",131847,9/26/22  1:53pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131847

I personally know many of my friends who were afraid to go home every night to their parents, in case they found out they were queer or trans, and serious harmed if not killed them. If you believe in protecting children, then give them spaces to explore their feelings and identities without shame and harm. If you are afraid of children being ""convinced"" to be transgender, then allow them spaces where it's okay to be fluid and be different. Forcing conformity ONLY hurts.

Achs student ,Virginia Achs student thoughts ,"As a Virginia Alexandria city student and a cousin of a trans youth I strongly disagree with this bill. I have always believed that school should be a place that is safe for students and growing up everyone told me that it was a safe place. Students are now scared. No one should be scared to go to school and to get a basic education. Whether or not someone is transgender or just prefer different pronouns shouldn’t make their education difficult to get or make school an unsafe environment. How someone wants to be identified as shouldn’t concern someone else. At this point it’s not just politics and getting a good reputation for your party it is just flat out discrimination and disrespectful. You are just going over the line with this bill. No one should be scared to go to school and you are making everyone feel unsafe transgender or not. Whats next classrooms for girls and classrooms for boys? Only female teachers? Girls can only wear dresses and skirts and boys can only wear pants and shorts? I sure hope not. It is 2022. I should be proud of everything this generation is doing and what we don’t have ti go through, but I’m not at all I’m actually very upset. we don’t live in the 1900s anymore. It is 2022. I really hope everyone thinks this through and change this. Again people shouldn’t be scared to go to school. ",131921,9/26/22  1:57pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131921

Daniel Burbano ,New Policy is detrimental to the student,"A parent has a right to help decide the child's Education, Safety and Fair treatment in schools. They do not have a right to choose whether their child's ""orientation"" is A or B. A lot of student's only escape from overbearing or abusive family is the school system. Students who can be themselves without worry or abuse are students who learn the best. We need our schools to provide a space where kids can learn and be themselves in an open and safe way. Only in one notion this Policy is correct, schools aren't here to raise our kids. Yet it goes on to counter this notion, it wants schools to act as an extension of the parents. But schools are here to educate, instruct, and provide options to the students. The student themselves determine what to do with this knowledge. THE STUDENT ALONE DECIDES WHO THEY ARE!

David Schlansker III ,This updated model policy will put children in danger,"The model policies on the privacy, dignity, and respect for all students and parents in Virginia’s public schools is a dangerous policy with a disingenuous title.  This will put more children in harm’s way due to domestic abuse and increase the incidence of suicide among kids and teens.  Many young people who are questioning their gender identity consider suicide if they conclude that they are gender nonconforming or trans, but cannot safely discuss it with their parents.  In these cases, a supportive teacher and school system can be a lifeline for them.  Additionally, it is a sad fact that some parents will abuse a child they perceive to be gender nonconforming or trans.  Exposing these vulnerable children to such negative outcomes is unconscionable, and has no place in a state with a slogan of “Virginia is for Lovers.”  I will be urging my state senator and state delegate to do whatever they can to blunt or reverse this model policy, should it move forward. ",131932,9/26/22  1:58pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=131932

Anonymous ,Let kids be kids rather than focusing on sexual orientation,"The parents should have parental rights when it comes to their children. If the school’s are given the power not to disclose paramount information pertaining to their child, who is liable if the child attempts and succeeds in taking their own life? Schools should not have the power to dictate a parent’s right on raising his/her child. If the school is responsible for reporting neglect and abuse of a child, the school must be mandated ito inform a parent about the child’s psychological and emotional status. How that parent chooses to deal with the issue is the parent’s rights, not the school.  Children do not have the necessary brain functions to deal sexual orientation at young ages. The mental health and wellness of a child is the responsibility of the parents. Denying the parents the records of any issue is grossly negligent of the educational system. Children should use bathrooms of their biological sex. The incident in Loudon County is a perfect example of why those restrictions should be enforced. It is the responsibility of the schools to not only protect transgender children but ALL children in their care.  Unless designated bathrooms are established for trans children, the safety of the other children in the school shall be enforced.",132045,9/26/22  2:02pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132045

Adam Simmons ,I am strongly opposed to the proposed  VDOE policy,"This is not about parental rights, this is about control. This policy, if put into action, will greatly harm trans, nonbinary, and even cisgender students.  I am a trans man. I have diagnosed gender dysphoria. I'm not in high school anymore, and I'm sure as hell glad I'm not now. So why do I care? I was that kid people called tr*nny behind my back. I was that kid that came to school to escape. I was even the advocate at my school. I worked tirelessly to make school the safe place everyone deserves, because school was my safe space. Teachers made me feel welcomed and, honestly, school saved me from suicide. I had a plan, my teachers and school kept me from executing it. This policy, in my view, will increase the already high suicide statistic for LGBTQ youth.  Students are humans too. They are allowed to have their own opinions, education, identities, ect.  Besides all of the evidence saying that trans kids are less depressed and less suicidal when they are in a supportive environment, the policy also seems to be going against the Grimm vs. Gloucester County case. Part of the proposed policy is prohibiting trans students from using the bathroom they identify with. However, if I remember correctly, The Grimm case stated that it was discrimination to stop trans kids from using the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. I was there for the school board meetings in my county discussing how they needed to change their policy. The verbal abuse myself and my peers endured was disgusting. This policy would make all of that worth nothing.  I fully oppose Governor Youngkin and this policy. Good day. ",132071,9/26/22  2:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132071

Julie Scott ,I completely support this policy,"This policy gives parents input and control of the way their children are addressed. It does not take away from the sub-population of children who believe they are trans. As a nurse, it is hard to believe that we are making gender a fuzzy concept. These CHILDREN should not be confused by this concept. Yes, there a very small contingent of persons who are transgender, etc.  The parenting roles should remain with the parents who are responsible for their children in all other areas. Also, all teachers should be protected by the 1st Admendment. I don’t think this directly discriminates against transgender students but recognizes that a policy for this small subgroup should not change the way all students are treated.  Many children have challenges such as autism, Down’s syndrome, etc.   What needs to happen is that we to accept differences in all?  I did not expect that everything should be changed for my autistic child. In summary, this has become a very leftist agenda item. ",132077,9/26/22  2:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132077

Carlie Pearson ,This is dangerous ,Research shows that using preferred pronouns and names for trans kids is literally lifesaving. The Trevor Project’s 2020 National Survey indicated that having their p referred pronouns used decreased likelihood that trans kids will attempt  suicide by 50%! Our number one goal as educators should be to keep our children safe. Giving kids a place where their identity is respected is an easy and necessary way to keep our kids safe. This proposed  legislation is over reaching and dangerous. ,132082,9/26/22  2:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132082

We must be supporting and strengthening protections for the most vulnerable, minoritized people in society. We must show them the full support and care they deserve. ""Imposing one's religious beliefs on another"" also misses the point entirely. Not only are there Christians who advocate for full inclusion and equity for trans people (and trans people can be Christians too!), but there are so many laws on the books rooted in a certain version of Christianity. And not that this is the main point, but strengthening protections, support, and care and uplift for the most vulnerable and excluded people will also make all of society more equitable. ",132104,9/26/22  2:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132104

"Juliette Gunter, student ",I strongly oppose. ,"I vehemently oppose this dangerous and harmful proposal. Passing it will result in hundreds of CHILDREN’S lives being put at risk. Do not claim to be protecting children, because all this is doing is protecting parents that refuse to respect and protect their children, which is their one job. It is absolutely absurd to pass a law that forces teachers to purposefully disrespect youth, and this policy will destroy relationships between educators and parents, parents and children, and children and educators. Who is this meant to help? It’s not helping teachers, and it’s certainly not helping the children. This policy will end lives. Suicide rates are already heartbreakingly high for LGBTQ+ youth, and this will only further exacerbate that. If you care even a little bit about the health and well-being of children, you will protect their rights at all cost, and that includes the right to be called by true their name and pronouns, not the ones their parents gave them. Let children be authentic, and let teachers and educators respect the people they are teaching without limiting free speech. ",132151,9/26/22  2:05pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132151

If parents should know more about their children or if legal guardians need to understand their dependents more fully…that’s on them, not a teacher. Let’s be smarter and more efficient about this.

Andrew Molloy ,Trans and Non-Binary Policy,"I am a 68 year old grandfather of a non-binary high school senior. Fortunately, my grandchild has supportive parents, siblings, grandparents, great grandparents and a host of other family and friends who support them. This is not the case with other transgender and non-binary school age children. To think that all these children can go to their parents and discuss their sexuality is absurd. The proposed policy puts transgender and non-binary children in potentially unsafe environments and situations. It is discriminatory towards a group of people who are, in reality, no different than other students other than their sexuality. This is not about parents rights, but more about political points and garnering support from a vocal minority. This is not about fair treatment of others, but rather the imposition of other's beliefs on these children. This is 2022, not 1922. Times have changed, people have evolved over the course of time and it is time for Virginia to change, especially politicians and others who want to live in the past. There is no need for this discriminatory, unfair, unjust and potentially very harmful policy. ",132162,9/26/22  2:05pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132162

Sofie Strompf ,This Policy is Hypocritical and Wrong,"This policy proposal uses phrases such as “bullying and harassment are prohibited,” however, the proposed change is inherently welcoming and therefore encouraging harassment and bullying of transgender students from their parents and caregivers. Many parents and guardians refuse to accept, or are slow to accept, their transgender children. Those who do not accept their transgender children often use harmful, hurtful language towards their children. This includes using their deadname and misgendering them, but also using language that indicates to their children that they do not accept them. The grounds of this policy are counter indicated in countless psychological and sociological research studies. This will do so much harm if it is passed. Please, so many Virginians are begging you, do not pass this policy. We are not in favor of harming children. We are not in favor of not accepting everyone.

Fairfax Dad ,This policy will result in children being bullied and some even dying.,"To suggest that not respecting a human being's sense of self is protected by the first amendment is plain cowardice. This policy enables students and teachers to bully transgender students when they already are vulnerable and unsure.  These students are at a higher risk of suicide because of intolerant and cruel social behaviors.  This policy doubles down on these terrible trends and will unfortunately result in deaths of children.  The impetus of this policy is fear.  Unfortunately many people find it hard to believe that the experience of others is different than the experience they themselves take for granted.  A person born male or female that feels that this is their natural gender assumes erroneously that everyone feels this way and that anyone who says differently must have an agenda.  But if they themselves are so sure of what they are, how can they possibly judge others for equally being sure (even if it differs from their experience).  Children are in the process of ""figuring it out"".  They need support and freedom to explore.  They need love and acceptance and safety.  They do not need cruelty and hate.  This policy of Youngkin is hateful and dangerous, and frankly inhuman.  The fact that this is even being proposed makes me ashamed to be a Virginian.",132171,9/26/22  2:06pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132171

Youngkin’s policy model are in direct conflict with recent court rulings and directly discriminate against children on the basis of sexual identity. A spokeswoman for the governor claimed that the policy “requires that schools treat every single student with dignity and respect” when this policy, in fact, will do the opposite. This model will effectively eliminate self expression and the personal identification of children who are already facing more than their share of societal bias and discrimination. Not only is this morally wrong, but is in direct violation of Virginia’s Human Rights Act.

Anonymous ,Strongly Oppose. Inclusivity is key to economic growth and development in our state.,"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-case-for-inclusive-growth  Protecting LGBTQIA+ youth, and all youth for that matter, through inclusive policies is critical to economic growth and development in Virginia. Even if you can't see (or choose not to see) the humanity of this minority, know that alienating them and depriving them of basic rights and protections will eventually impact your wallet and quality of life in this state. Expect to see higher levels of violence and mental health crises, more people leaving the state or public school system to provide their children inclusive opportunities, lower graduation rates for those who cannot leave, and more poverty overall. More people systemically pushed into poverty and public assistance. Expect to see an even larger need for educators as those professionals are unwilling to continue to be underpaid, underserved, and expected to alienate students or be the cause of their deteriorating mental health (or even self-harm).  Perhaps a more productive way to prioritize school safety would be focusing on modernizing schools that are outdated (facilities in disrepair, wiring, HVAC, toxic chemicals and materials, outdated security systems, a lack of technology and materials to facilitate an academically rigorous curriculum). Invest in our students and our faculties and you will see our local communities, and entire state thrive.  -- A concerned parent and educator in VA",,9/26/22  2:07pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132193

Shay B. ,This bill will KILL children,"This bill not only polices children's gender expression, but poses serious harm to children in Virginia. In 2021, record high numbers of hatecrimes, including 50 fatalities (Human Right Campaign). Many transgender people can attest to facing abuse at home. Amongst peers and friends at school can often be a safe place for young people to explore their identity. That should be protected. No one, ever, deserves to be outed. ESPECIALLY with the consideration that many people are transphobic and frequently verbally abuse, and yes, physically abuse, their children.   Besides the danger of outing children to their parents, it is INSANE to me that teachers could have the ""right"" to misgender a student based on their beliefs. I'm sorry, but calling people the name they want to be called is basic human respect. Pronouns really aren't that difficult to figure out. I would hope that any person in charge of educating the next generation would be able to properly structure a sentence using someone's preferred pronouns.   Make no mistake, this policy, if enacted, WILL KILL CHILDREN. For goodness sake, just let kids be kids, explore their identities in healthy and safe envirments, and TEACH THEM THINGS rather than using schools as a political tool to oppress and criminalize trans folks.",132285,9/26/22  2:10pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132285

Naomi McQuade ,Against the 2022 Model Policy,"I fully oppose the 2022 Model Policies regarding transgender students. It is not the job of public schools to enforce the gender of any student. Being forced to use the nurse's bathroom, a private bathroom, or the bathroom that does not correspond to one's true gender is humiliating. Misgendering transgender students is degrading and psychologically harmful. 'Outing' transgender students to their parents often places them in danger for which the schools have no intention of taking responsibility. It should be the decision of the kid to tell their parents, not the school: for parents no more choose the gender of their kid than they choose the weather, and should not be empowered to do so. The family dynamic of a transgender student is significantly different than the family of a cisgender student, in that there is usually a threat at home when the kid is only ""out"" at  school. This policy guidance belies a willing ignorance to acknowledge this difference, and, barely concealed underneath, an eliminationist agenda that is growing nationwide. No matter the pretense and the justification, these policies are specifically harmful to a few kids, whereas accommodating them would harm none. Please do not gratify traditional bigotry by adopting these policies, but rather protect the health and lives of transgender students.",132298,9/26/22  2:10pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132298

Patrick Foos ,Drastic Improvement on Previous Policy,"These policies are an enormous improvement over the policies previously which actively enabled schools to undermine parental rights. The previous policies, which suggested that schools should consider lying to parents explicitly and by omission, were a black mark on the state of Virginia. The new policies are direct, to the point, and succeed in creating explicit regulations to protect both parents and children from schools implementing the deceptively titled ""affirmative care"" in the form of social transition without consent or even knowledge of the parents. By returning power to parents and recognizing biological realities, the new policies protect all students and parents from the insidious overreach of the former policies. The policy regarding name changes to be parentally authorized is the best that it can be, as far I can see. The provision allowing for nicknames associated with the name on the roster is likely going to be abused somewhat, but such abuse, if it does occur, will be clearly against policy. While the necessity of parental authorization for such a broad range of potential names is harsh, it is necessary to ensure that the policy is difficult to abuse. I am curious to see if the provision protecting the rights of teachers to refer to students in accordance with constitutionally protected beliefs will be used by teachers who wish to call a student by a name or pronouns that do not match the sex observed at birth.  The former set of policies abused data and facts to push a specific agenda, used dogmatic and unproveable terms like gender identity, cited activist organizations, used activist terminology like ""sex assigned at birth"" to obfuscate biological facts, and failed to consult any parents in its creation. See also my article Whose Children are They? for more discussion on those policies and the resulting policies published by FCPS. The new policies re-center parental authority, facts, and protections for those unwilling to concede to the progressive dogma.

Becky ,I agree with much of this policy but kids need a bathroom ,"I believe all children should be protected and safe at school. To me this means trans students should have access to a safe, separate bathroom and changing room but it doesn’t seem fair or safe to everyone for them to be in a bathroom different than their biological sex. I also don’t think it’s fair for them to play sports outside their biological because biology is irrefutable.  Women have worked too hard for our rights and protections to give it away so easily. I think co-Ed options are a good compromise. I don’t want to hurt any child but that includes regular girls and boys. I feel strongly that parents should always be notified and in the conversation if a child wants to change their name or pronouns at school. The fact that some school officials think differently makes me very distrustful of them. I have been a proponent of public education until recently and now I don’t really trust my kids in the public schools. ",132393,9/26/22  2:13pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132393

Anonymous ,Absolutely support this!,"As a supporter of ALL people no matter your gender or sexual preference, I fully support this measure. We have to protect ALL our children, not just the ones that are different from the “norm”. If a transgender student is not comfortable getting dressed in the locker room or using the restroom they are required to use then let them use a separate space for staff. It is important ALL our students feel safe, not just transgender students. So now we’re supposed to choose to make a number or possibly all the students in a restroom or locker room feel uncomfortable or unsafe for maybe one or two are transgender?? No! That’s ludicrous. All we have to do is take note of the attacks on female students in Northern Virginia and see how some students will take advantage of an opportunity to be in the girls locker rooms and bathrooms. There should continue to be and ALWAYS be a separation of the sexes with an exception for trans students to have their own private area to change, use the restroom, and stay at an overnight event. That way we are not inhibiting any one student’s right to safety and comfort.",132410,9/26/22  2:14pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132410

Sarah (Parent of two school-aged kids) ,Strongly oppose,"These model policies are discriminatory and harmful. Thankfully, many trans or non-binary kids are supported at home and in school. In my experience, those parents are intimately involved in their children’s schooling. Unfortunately, some children feel more comfortable and safe addressing issues of identity or expression with other trusted adults. We have the saying “it takes a village” for a reason. Those kids should have a safe space to share who they are, especially if they fear repercussion or violence at home. The new policies have been framed as “parents’ rights” but they are only masking as such. Parents have rights but so do children. And ALL of our children are safer, happier, and healthier when they are free to be themselves and to seek the guidance of their trusted teachers and counselors. Please do not create policies that will hurt our children, both by making them feel more ostracized and by possibly subjecting them to violence in the homes. The current (not the proposed) model policies are affirming for all children, and all children should have access to a safe place of public education without fear of ramifications for simply being who they are.  ",132533,9/26/22  2:18pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132533

Julie D ,Strong support for these policies,"I am writing to strongly support these policies.  The responsibility to raise our children belongs solely with the parents/guardians, not with the State.  The State is charged with providing an education to our children. For those who believe this policy will endanger children because it would require parents to be notified if a student is considering a gender change, that is a close minded, stereotypical belief that parents won’t support their children.  With the recent incidents in Loudoun County where a female was assaulted in a girls restroom by a boy who was dressed as a girl, these policies will ensure the ensured safety of girls in our public schools.  Safety, security and education are the three major responsibilities of our public schools, not gender counseling and hiding concerns from parents.

Clearly, you aren’t interested in moving our state forward; this is just another stunt (e.g., flying refugees to Martha’s Vineyard), just more red meat to throw to your Trumpian base. Another move backward to placate a bunch of Q-anon knuckleheads and religious extremists who want to drag us back to the Middle Ages. We do not live in a theocray.  As a wise woman once said, “You’re about to lose your job.” You’ve done more to energize non-political people than you will ever know.

Roberta L Gosling ,I vehemently oppose this,"Dear Governor Youngkin - I am urging you to keep the current legislation that was put forth by Senators Boysko and Simon and passed in 2020 to protect the rights of ALL Students. This legislation was thoughtfully researched and passed because of the way it treats all people - parents, teachers, and students with respect. Specifically, as noted by Senator Boysko, ""Parents were involved in this, students were involved in this, teachers were involved in this, as well as 9,000 comments from the public, who helped us craft this model policy"" that you and your office are trying to repeal. As also noted: ""Research shows us that transgender and nonbinary students feel more comfortable in their schools when they can use the names that they prefer to be called by,"" said Katina Harris, a teacher with RPS. ""A welcoming classroom is a loving classroom and that’s what our educators provide for our students. When we don’t provide these things, we see more anxiety, depression and suicide in our students."" It's time that we approach these issues from a place of compassion and keep the legislation in place that protects our students and teachers alike and refrain from the cruelty that is the hallmark of MAGA Republicans. When you campaigned, you distanced yourself from MAGA Republican cruelty and Virginians took you at your word. Let's bring compassion back to the political discourse and do what we all know is right for our children, teachers, and parents. Thank you for your consideration.

Anonymous ,Needlessly cruel to an already scared minority.,"Governor Youngkin's new policy will cause incalculable harm to children. As a trans person who attended Virginia's public school, I can attest that it is absolutely terrifying to open yourself up in a way that deviates from what your parents have in mind for you. School is one of the few places where a child is able to grow apart from their parents, and it provides them with the necessary freedom to grow into their own individual. A parent is a caretaker and companion, but they should not have the power to outright deny the agency of their child in determining their own identity. Trans kids want nothing more than to find acceptance among their peers and teachers, and to be able to pursue an education without fear. While it is scary for a parent to see their child change, leveraging the power of the state to restrict their lives in a place they are meant to feel safe is a mistake. If parents want to control their child to this degree through this policy, I strongly urge them to instead talk to their child. Your child transitioning or experimenting with their identity is not as scary as it may seem, and your support would mean the world to them.",132591,9/26/22  2:20pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132591

Patrick Salsburg ,"I vehemently oppose this blatant act of bigotry, which also happens to be illegal.","Middle school and high school are awkward times of change and transition for any child and teenager. For cisgender students, it can be a painful and humiliating experience, but it is nothing compared to the suffering transgender students may face.   For a state that should be trying to embrace its motto of being ""for Lovers"" and not reminding people that it was the capital of the Confederacy during the Civil War and led the charge for Jim Crow laws to harm Black people, Virginia should not want to sully its reputation by trying to discriminate and harm transgender students. Some bigots (such as our Governor) say that this guidance will protect cisgender students from people posing as transgender who want to go to the bathroom with them. This is completely false, absurd, and offensive!! The idea that any non-transgender person would pretend to be a member of a group that is more likely to be discriminated against, harassed, and murdered is insane. Many transgender students who are transitioning would much rather that they aren't constantly being looked at during this awkward stage of life. If a cisgender person had been subjected to everyone staring and talking about them behind their back and sometimes threatening or hurting them for something out of their control, it would most likely shock every Virginian to the bone -- including Governor Youngkin, who I'm sure would condemn such behavior. Yet, if it happens to transgender students or members of another marginalized group, this policy basically says it's fine and should be expected.   Why should it be okay for a teacher to refuse to call a student by their preferred name? If a cisgender male student named ""Jonathan"" wanted to go by ""John"", this should be allowed. And the same goes if a transgender female student whose birth name was ""Jonathan"" wants to go by ""Johanna."" If a teacher can selectively honor the wish of one student and not another, this can create irreparable harm to individual students, classroom dynamics, and the education experience.   In order to improve academic achievement, Virginia needs to make the education experience more enjoyable. When students are happy and feel safe at school, they will want to do their homework and want to come to school. By making school a more dangerous place for transgender students and allowing for acts of bigotry to be commonplace, many students will lose their academic focus and not want to come to school anymore. Not to mention that this will drastically increase depression and attempts at suicide that are already too common among transgender students. Governor Youngkin and his bigoted posse who drafted this document are directly to blame if there is any increase in suicide attempts or depression among transgender students.   This proposed policy is also illegal. In the case of Gavin Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stated in 2020 that it was unconstitutional to deny access to transgender students from the bathroom of the gender they identify with. This proposed policy ignores that basic fact and also violates the Virginia Human Rights Act, which states that it is illegal to discriminate based on gender identity.    Not only should the proposed guidance from bigoted Governor Youngkin not go into effect, the Virginia Department of Education should try to make all students (especially transgender, nonbinary, and other members of the LGBTQ+ student population) feel more comfortable in their own skin during their experience in school. I have lived in Virginia almost my entire life and hope for a day when this state will finally embrace all its citizens with love and unity rather than hate and division. Please, do not implement this new policy.",132633,9/26/22  2:21pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132633

Kellie Cannon ,Welcome Trans Youth ,"As a mental health clinician, I cannot emphasize enough how harmful Governor Youngkin's policy will impact the Trans youth in Virginia. Children/Youth need to be believed, affirmed, and supported to thrive and flourish into their personhood. When a childhood is told how to feel without honoring their own self-identity, this increases mental health distress and can impact their physical well-being in the long run. This trickles into their ability to do well as citizens in our communities, as well as create and maintain meaningful relationships. Accepting a child's identity empowers them to continue in their development, grow in self-awareness, feel safe, and feel hopeful for their futures. #TransYouthBelongVA I oppose Governor Youngkin's policy.",132661,9/26/22  2:22pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132661

William D ,SEVERLY OPPOSE | Stop making trans children suffer,"The proposed document does not respect a child's wish to be who they truly are. They should have the freedom like any other American citizen who has free will to be called and identify as they choose. We're talking about the well-being of the children affected by this document, not the parents. Instilling this proposed document may as well say ""Come kill my transgender child""; You are forcing that child who comes to school, respects their teachers, school staff, their peers and putting them on the chopping block because you have just outed them to their family, who may very well be transphobic. Who knows what the parents would do to a child that goes against something THEY believe in? Everyone has the freedom to believe in whatever they want, and that also goes for the children this affects. You don't suddenly get the freedom of religion when you turn 18; you earn that RIGHT when you are born or become a U.S citizen. Approval of this proposed document may very well kill dozens of transgender children and endanger many more. The blood will be on your hands. I don't know how I'd deal with that if I were in a position like yours.   The fight to be treated normally in a world, state, county, and school where you are not accepted makes the 40% transgender suicide rate inflate exponentially.

Gabrielle ,I strongly oppose this policy. It will do more harm than good.,"The 2022 Model Policies are a politically motivated attempt to use trans students as a bargaining chip. Unlike the 2021 Model Policies, the authors of the 2022 Model Policies did not consult with experts in relevant fields (or with students who will be most impacted by the policies). Nor did the new policies cite empirical research and statistics to support this arbitrary course of action. It is laughable that policymakers are using ""parental rights"" as a justification while ignoring the well-documented harm that arises when a trans student's gender identity is revealed to their unsupportive parents. In an ideal world, parents would not abuse their children (or cause them to become homeless) for being themselves. However, the objective reality, which most educators are aware of, is that parents do not always act in the best interest of their children. It will be on your shoulders if this new policy results in greater physical, emotional, and mental harm to students. Instead of teaching all students to rise to the level of compassion and respect that our society desperately needs, you are giving them permission to bully and harass people who have been historically subject to discrimination. Furthermore, this policy may conflict with federal law (see the decision in Grimm v. Gloucester).",132708,9/26/22  2:24pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132708

Anonymous ,Protect Trans Kids and Protect Them In School!!!,"I fully support trans kids and respect what their preferences are above all else. Gov Youngkin and his attempt to remove the boundaries and safety that protect trans kids in school (public schools in this case) is a disgrace to our state. My family was one of the founding members of this state and would actively fight against what Youngkin stands for. Virginia is a monumental state, that played a vital role in humans rights and continues to play a part in that. Youngkin and his party fail to understand or represent the population of the state of Virginia. Trans rights should progress in school, and as a parent of a child that attends a Virginia public school I cannot tell you how upset and disappointed I was when Youngkin and his party started inserting themselves into our school systems the way they have, especially in our county of Loudoun. Our children are our future. Our cisgender, queer, and transgender children are not being fairly represented by Youngkin. Our children deserve better than the inequality he is forcing. ",132722,9/26/22  2:24pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132722

Anonymous ,Trans kids will be harmed by this policy? ,"Trans children are very often times in a very precarious position. Most times, their situation is relying on a parent that hates trans people. If the parent is in the know about everything that a child does in school, what happens is that the trans students are put in a position that creates a sense of self loathing and the inability to confide in anyone about themselves. They don't know that these feelings are ok. If noone ever tells them that these feelings are ok, there could be disastrous consequences. What's more, if the parents are staunchly hateful they may bring harm to their child, or drive the child to self harm. Parental rights are important but not at the cost of the child's safety. Please do not pass this.  It will not benefit anyone except people who hate for no reason. ",132737,9/26/22  2:24pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132737

Mark Egger ,"""transgender"" is fake anti-science","These new policies are a 100% improvement over the previous policies.  There is no such thing as ""transgender"".  ""Gender"" is a grammatical term.  Nouns in some foreign languages have a gender - masculine or feminine.   Human beings do not have a ""gender"".  Human beings have a sex, and it is either male or female.   No matter how many body parts you chop off a child, a boy is still a boy and a girl is still a girl.  To pretend that there is something called ""transgender"" is anti-science and anti-biology.  Let's hope that thousands of lawsuits are filed against the doctors, school boards, school administrators, teachers, and yes, parents, of these children who have had their lives ruined physically and mentally by the people who were supposed to be raising them.  Let's also hope that when the wimpy Republicans take over the General Assembly in the 2023 elections, they will completely repeal the ridiculous sneaky law that was passed in 2020 that required the DOE to issue policies on a fake condition called ""transgender"". ",132751,9/26/22  2:25pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132751

Robert J. Anderson ,Let's Keep Our Minds and Hearts Open,"It appears from newspaper accounts, which include comments by school administrators, Gov. Youngkin's office, the ACLU, and the LBGTQ community that what the legislation is seeking to achieve is to retard some of the efforts made under Gov. Northam to more fairly treat our students in public schools. This is regrettable. Children -- all children -- need supportive parents, teachers, peers and communities which are welcoming, non-threatening, and understanding. Especially adolescents find navigating life more complicated than younger students. The Education Dept. should focus on providing the psychological and cultural environment which fosters growth, acceptance, thoughtful socialization and forbearance than on erecting barriers to young people's self-realization. I believe the pending legislation will interfere with the educational process, confuse parents and their children, and teachers and administrators about what is and what is not acceptable behavior around individuals' most personal, well-intended choices. The transgender question is a difficult one to address adequately, but we should strive for inclusiveness and understanding, not conformity for conformity's sake. Surely, there are better ways to achieve that goal than through the pending, regressive bill.",132754,9/26/22  2:25pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132754

Shawn Hambright ,"more stupid, backwards thinking ideas","This proposed policy is an excuse for politicians to curry political points while causing undue distress for kids simply trying to figure out who they are. When I was in school, most—not all, but most, teachers simply asked what name we’d like to use on the first day. I used my middle name. Even the teachers that didn’t ask were fine when I told them. So will parents have to send a note to school now if kids want to use their middle name, or a nickname? What BUSINESS is it of ANYONES what some kid prefers to be called? These policies seem like another attempt to bully and delegitimize someone based on simply who they are. They are NO DIFFERENT than many of the arguments racists used to use to justify segregating public spaces (like bathrooms) by race. These ideas are UN-AMERICAN, a giant step backwards in any decent society, and fly in the face of our First Amendment protections.  And finally, we have schools across our state crumbling to the ground, pest problems, teachers quitting in record numbers, but THIS is what our governor and other politicians want to waste time and money on? Further demonstration of the fact that they do not represent all Virginians, only those that go to the same church.

Drew Olsen ,Kids should be safe,"Schools are where children need to be able to be safe. If they are denied their own identity, then we cannot expect them to be able to learn or engage in their schools or school-work. As a future parent of a student in the Virginia school system, it scares me to think that the state is determining a child's identity rather than the student themselves. Trans kids are also just kids, so we should do everything we can to protect them. Being a kid is really hard, the state should be protecting them, not making things even harder!",132814,9/26/22  2:27pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132814

Anonymous ,Applaud and Support this Policy Change,"I applaud the governor’s move and support this policy change totally and unequivocally. I am trans, or more precisely, I suffer from autogynephilia. Had the current policies been in place during the time I was in the Fairfax County Public Schools, it is very possible it would have led to my transitioning to a sex I will never be, and likely, would have led to a life of depression, confusion, and ongoing medical problems. Gender dysphoria is a mental disorder that cannot be solved by misleading children into believing they can be a sex they are not. And yet, our culture has become obsessed with the idea that sex and gender are both malleable and interchangeable. This is false, misleading, disingenuous, and dangerous. When we meet a schizophrenic, do we agree with them that their imaginary friends are real? Of course not. By introducing these concepts into the schools, we are causing a social contagion. Until recently, transgenderism was not even something that we dealt with in general. Nowadays, we castrate young boys and perform double mastectomies on young girls in the name of compassion. But none of this has been happening for very long, and down the road, when these poor children realize what they have done, there will be a comeuppance for the parents and professionals that allowed it to happen. The suicide rates that many cite are simply false. The rate of suicide for trans people, according to numerous studies, are only temporarily lowered by patronizing people’s mental illness. After transition surgery, the suicide rates of around 40% remain the same. In other words, those who say it is better to have a living trans son than a dead daughter is a false dichotomy. The day of reckoning may be delayed, but since the mental illness is not being addressed, the problem never goes away. It is time to stop this insane social experiment of collapse into androgyny. Nothing good will come of it, since when the barbarians come pounding at the gate, the men that could have protected us will all have become women.",132904,9/26/22  2:29pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132904

MHL ,Please uphold this new VDOE guide. It's common sense and gives rights back to parents,"This new VDOE Guidance document does not take away the rights of trans parents. It simply makes sure that parents are aware of their child's proclivities.  If the parents support this new identity, schools will comply.  All this does is place the parents in a position of knowing what their children are being exposed to, and to decide on appropriate guidance for the child.  If there is a danger of abuse, CPS must be notified. I will agree that all children deserve to receive a quality education, free from identity politics. Schools have anti bullying rules in place, which must be enforced by teachers and administration. The push for making all students subservient to the small percentage of trans students is not in keeping with the spirit of ""majority"".  There have been problems with those who call themselves female accessing girls bathrooms in schools and causing harm.  A good many girls now are afraid to use the bathrooms in schools for fear of assault.  Give trans students separate bathrooms, but don't allow unfettered, unquestioned access to whatever bathroom a student identifies with on that particular day.  Sleepovers, sports, and formerly segregated-by-sex activities should revert to that default.  Parents are responsible for their children and should never be excluded from school activities, curriculum input, or access to controversial books, no matter whether in libraries or in class.  Likewise, parents deserve to speak their mind at school board meetings without fear of reprisal from the DOJ and FBI.  For too long, parents in VA were subjected to Gov. Northam's draconian rule.  His VDOE guidance must go and be replaced by Gov. Youngkin's common sense one.  As someone said, ""Elections have consequences.""      ",132917,9/26/22  2:29pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132917
Anonymous ,I fully OPPOSE this,"The proposed policies are contrary to state law and will be extremely harmful to transgender and nonbinary kids. Not to mention this will be harmful to all children because it teaches them that we do not have to be a tolerant or respectful society and that you must hide who you truly are out of fear. I FULLY OPPOSE this. It will affect all Virginians, but it will directly impact a close friend of mine and her child, I am asking you to put your personal beliefs aside and do what is right, which is to treat Virginians equally and NOT pass these proposed policies. ",132919,9/26/22  2:29pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132919

Anshu Sharma ,Schools are not surveillance apparatuses for parents,"Every single student, regardless of their school environment (public, private, religious, magnet, charter, homeschool), and regardless of whether their parents or guardians understand what it means to be transgender or LGBTQ+, deserves support from educators and from school administration, faculty, and staff. This model policy, if implemented, would cause great harm to transgender students and families and to all students who would wonder whether they have to pick between going to trusted adults for guidance or staying silent lest information be disclosed to their parents or guardians that students don't want disclosed. School staff disclosing information about a student's gender, sexuality, or other personal characteristic to their parents or guardians without the student's consent can lead to that student being abused. Students are not their parents' or guardian's property, and schools are not surveillance apparatuses for parents or guardians. The Department of Education needs to protect the interests of students, revoke the proposed 2022 model policy, and enforce the 2021 model policy. ",132933,9/26/22  2:30pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=132933

You are contributing to the problem. You are harming not only the children that this policy targets, but all of the other children as well, since you are actively instilling your own hateful ideas into their heads. Hate breeds hate. You have failed them all. As a teacher and fellow human being, I am beyond disappointed and disgusted by your actions.

Fatima M. Smith (FMS Speaks) ,I OPPOSE -- this policy is dangerous,"As a parent & resident of the Commonwealth, I, Fatima M. Smith, oppose this policy. This policy is in direct opposition to what transgender and nonbinary students in the Commonwealth have asked for. It is our duty to protect our youth and cultivate safer spaces for them to learn, grow & thrive.  This current policy does not reflect the Commonwealth’s commitment to provide safe and inclusive communities for Virginia’s children to thrive.  I have over 15 years of experience as an advocate and educator for anti-violence and my work has allowed me to work for youth and young adults who identify within the LGBTQIA+ community. What I have learned is that youth and young adults are capable of identifying not only problems but solutions. Transgender & nonbinary youth have expressed how painful this new policy is. The Governor and administration must be responsive to the voices of Virginia's youth. I must also add that trans & nonbinary youth, especially those who are Black & Brown, express extremely high rates of abuse, being unhoused, and suicidal ideation & attempts. When our homes aren't safe, we should be able to expect that schools will be safe spaces for youth. ALL children should feel safe in school regardless of their gender identity, race, or sexuality. The proposed policy will alter the image of school as a safe space for LGBTQIA students. The proposed policy change will invalidate the lived experiences of youth who are bravely living their authentic lives, only to be unprotected and oppressed in schools.",133192,9/26/22  2:36pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133192

Anne  Wendling ,"Harmful, not evidence based. ","Asking a school to refer to a child by their name does not infringe on parental rights. This is merely bigotry, veiled as “parental rights” and it goes against everything that the experts (like the American Academy of Pediatrics) tell us about how to take care of our trans and non-binary students. The application of these guidelines will not give parents the right to determine their child’s gender. The kids are figuring that out on their own. What it will do is put trans and non-binary children in danger- either from themselves (we know that acknowledging gender identify is suicide prevention) or from caregivers who might harm them, should they be “outed.” Listen to the experts.

We have seen the moral decay in our school systems for too long. ""Equity"" has replaced education and indoctrination is all that's been taking place.

Christina Martin ,Vehemently oppose,"It is unfortunate that such harmful legislation could be considered by our state leadership. Deadnaming (using the name assigned at birth versus the chosen name) trans individuals is an act of disrespect of one's very identity and causes trauma, which further alienates and disempowers the youth that our nation will depend on for future leadership. A person's identity should always be respected, that goes for their name as well as pronouns. It should not be hard to see that this legislation is unnecessary and cruel. Instead of demonizing families for living authentically, perhaps the Virginia school system could instead focus on teaching facts that help support all people from all walks of life, and destroy the outdated, unscientific, ""Christian"" teachings that actively do harm to society. This baseless move for the disenfranchisement of trans individuals and youth is clearly one created to bolster support from the extremist idiots whose beliefs hope to reverse social progress and drag our state and country down into a christofascist theocracy. Please consider the trajectory that such laws, if passed, will lead us down.

Anonymous ,This policy will kill trans students.,"I am a Virginia resident and voter. I expect to raise my children here. This policy makes me worry for their safety here. Several of the comments on here have focused on the policy’s endangerment of trans students, which is very real: The forced outing and/or state-imposed gender dysphasia will lead to immense inner turmoil and contemplations of suicide from many trans students, and will also lead to (sometimes violent) persecution of these students by their peers, teachers, school administrators, parents, and more. This policy will also harm cis students, and particularly neurodivergent cis students, who struggle socially. More immediately, these students may be forced to comply with this policy for trans students—a group that this policy treats as synonymous with delusional or mentally ill—just for being different, thus subjecting them to the same harms as trans students. More broadly, this policy harms all Virginia students by stripping them of their autonomy over their identity: Forcing them to conform to the state’s definition of “normal” has the effect of either turning them into mindless clones of one another or punishing independent, creative minds until they do conform with Virginia’s image of “normal”—until they become an automaton.",133292,9/26/22  2:38pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133292

Steve H ,95% Of Kids Who Think They are Trans Will Later Realize The Are Not,Do not allow any person other than the child's parents to make any decision to alter in any way a child. Studies show that some 95% of kids who are confused about their gender will later on find out their gender is what they were born with. What we have are sick people who think they know better and will transition kids to be something else and it is irreversible. Allow kids to be kids and stop teaching them about sexuality till they are in their teens and in an appropriate setting. And do not let anyone but the parents make medical decisions for their kids.,133326,9/26/22  2:39pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133326

Ann Marie Rodgerson ,New Model Policy,"I strongly oppose this for a number of reasons. 1. It unfairly targets trans students.  These students are at risk of suicide and laws like this increase the chances they will die early. 2. it is poorly written. Who determines what a “commonly associated nickname” is?  If a student goes by a middle name, a family name, or an Americanized name, would that be forbidden? 3. It expects teachers to call students by pronouns based on biological sex. I have no idea what the biological sex of my students is, nor do I have any business speculating on student biology. ",133354,9/26/22  2:39pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133354

Aimee - Loudoun County ,I,I support the new VDOE guidelines for schools. School’s need to worry more about the academics and less on kids feelings. They are teens and emotions change daily. Adults put all these thoughts in kids head. Shame on those who want to push their own agenda. You aren’t helping kids and are actually making them feel worse and less accepted. There should be provisions for true trans kids but they will be the slight minority and the rest of the kids don’t have to feel uncomfortable just because of a few.,133378,9/26/22  2:40pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133378

Riley Cohen ,This is about conformity and control,"Do you have firsthand experience working with suicidal transgender children? Because I do. This is not a hypothetical - I am a mental health counselor and graduate of Fairfax County Public Schools. I watched my friends struggle with the psychological impact of knowing that people like you did not want them to exist. Many of them did not feel safe to be themselves at home. Many had supportive parents, myself included, but students should be able to choose how and when to talk about their identity, because children are people who deserve basic autonomy. There is nothing sexual or harmful about a child, for example, asking to be called a different name - but you know that, because you know this isn't really about protecting children, this is about conformity and control. Pandering to bigots will not protect your political legacy. I am embarrassed to be a Virginian and deeply concerned for the trans kids whose identities and existence have become a political pawn. Your bigotry will have damaging consequences, but you already know that too - do you care? Or do you believe we deserve our suffering for daring to question your beliefs about gender and authority?",133404,9/26/22  2:40pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133404

Kids should have the right to be called by whatever name they choose. They should be able to use whichever pronouns they are. Why torcher LGBTQ kids further? Life is already harder for them. Just let them live in the most comfortable environment possible. The bill appears to not follow Federal laws so there will be plenty of litigation fighting it. ,133421,9/26/22  2:41pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133421

Dee Jackson ,I OPPOSE rolling back rights for transgender children.,"I OPPOSE rolling back rights for transgender children. The governor wants to force trans children to ""out"" themselves to their parents even if they don't feel safe at home. Keep in mind that many trans children are mentally and physically abused, disowned, shunned from the community and church, forced into abusive conversion ""therapy,"" and thrown out of the house and onto the streets by their parents just because they're trans. Many trans children are homeless for this reason. If they refuse to be outed to their parents, that gives the school the right to humiliate them by misgendering them and deadnaming them among other indignities like not being able to use the toilet or play sports on teams that match their gender identity. If you know anything about the care of trans children, you would know how important it is to affirm their identities and protect them. These kids have it hard enough. Please don't make their lives any harder. This bill does anything but. I strongly oppose this bill.",133535,9/26/22  2:44pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133535

Tom Ferguson ,"STRONGLY support, thank you Gov. Youngkin!","I strongly support the Governor's proposed 2022 Model Policies for students and parents.  There is a lot of noise around this issue, all of it intentionally unfounded.  These policies are not only in line with the 14th Amendment of our (still valid) U.S. Constitution (and supporting case law), they are also in line with our (still valid) Code of Virginia, Section 1-240.1, with actual biological science (only two sexes/genders actually exist), the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and lastly in keeping with common sense, which is clearly not common.   The Governor and his Administration could not have been more clear about providing a safe and nurturing environment for all students, full stop.  The intentional twisting of the facts by the ""progressive"" left is both shameless and reckless, in addition to completely false.  Better that we soon begin to actually do the real and hard work of educating our precious children in our once strong public schools, lest they soon will be further embarrassed on the world stage and in the global workforce due to their lack of command of the basics.  Until we can get our levels of proficiency nearer to the 85-90th percentile, we'd do well to leave the complex, social fads de jour outside of our schools.   Parents were, are, and will always be the best at helping their children navigate the complexities of this world.  Our children are not, and will never be, wards of the state.",133568,9/26/22  2:44pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133568

For example, you cannot treat a trans student with dignity and respect, and protect their personal information, while demanding they use a bathroom they are not comfortable using. Forcing trans children to come out to family before they are ready can be very dangerous to the child’s well being. These, among so many issues in this policy, do not reflect what experts in education, development, and psychology advocate as good policy.  Please, do not adopt this harmful policy!",133613,9/26/22  2:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133613

Nicky Tilley ,I OPPOSE this guidance.,"I OPPOSE the guidance. I am a parent of school-age children in Virginia. Virginia should be following the federal guidelines on this matter, not creating an oppressive school system dedicated to denying students identities and policing their sexuality. ""Every student deserves to learn in a safe and supportive setting, free from discrimination. As the Department of Education has reaffirmed, discrimination based on sex—including sexual orientation and gender identity—isn’t just wrong, it’s prohibited in America’s schools. Yet many lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) students experience bullying, harassment, and other discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.For transgender students in particular, this discrimination can threaten students’ well-being and ability to thrive or even participate in school—one national survey found that transgender students were three times more likely to miss school than other students. Additional research cited in a report from the Department’s Office for Civil Rights found transgender youth were more likely to report feeling unsafe at school and being bullied, and that the COVID-19 pandemic harmed their mental health. Some transgenderstudents experience multiple forms of discrimination at once, including race, gender or disability discrimination, which amplify the challenges they face.""-https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/ed-factsheet-transgender-202106.pdf",,9/26/22  2:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133624

Being trans is a way someone can be, not a belief system, and framing it as such is incredibly harmful because it adds to the narrative that one might have ulterior motives in being trans which in almost every case (minus those minuscule number of cases in which someone is not truly trans but instead claiming to be.)

Whitney King ,This is unacceptable,"Governor Youngkin has made it very clear that he is going to make any person who is not a white, cisgender, Christian man will be a second-class citizen while living in Virginia. There are so many reasons that the actions that he is taking are unacceptable and should not even be considered legitimate.  There are so many other reasons why this policy is disgusting, but I have listed two that on their own should stop these policies in their tracks. 1.) This is illegal Youngkin has acted in diranddiction to the actions of the legislature as well as the judiciary branch. Youngkin is not allowed to act alone. He is not the sole governing body of Virginia. The legislative branch has codified transgender protections by statutorily guaranteeing that Virginia schools create policies to protect issues faced by transgender youth schools. See Virginia Code § 22.1-23.3. Additionally, the Virginia Supreme Court struck down a bathroombathroomsd not allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matched their gender identity. See Grimm v. Gloucester. Acting completely autonomously, Youngkin is acting not only outside the bounds of authority awarded to the Executive branch but in direct contradiction to what the Virginia population wants. 2.) The effects that this will have on transgender youth are fatal 59% of transgender youth have reported experiencing suicidal thoughts within the last year. See npr.gov. This is over double the rate of suicidal ideation for cisgender kids. Gender-affirming resources and services are enormous in keeping the rates of suicide and other mental health issues down. Invalidating the gender identity of transgender youth will have a negative impact and cause an increase in transgender suicides in Virginia. The requirement for parents to be informed poses a safety risk for these children. Transgender people are at a much higher risk of violence (via CDC reports). This violence is not exclusive to people outside of their families. 40% of homeless youth are LGBTQIA+, with being forced out of their family home cited as the number one reason being the primary reason. Their families force out over 80% of transgender homeless youth. (See truecolorsunited.org).  By forcing transgender youth to come out to their families in order to have their gender affirmed in schools, Youngkin is exposing these youth to risks of violence and homelessness. ",133635,9/26/22  2:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133635

It seems there had been a problem of boys being in the girls room and using it as a hookup spot. As woman, I can tell you I am way more afraid of straight, cisgender males than I have ever been of a transgender woman. Should transgender children be forced to limit the amount of liquid they drink in a day to cater to people’s ignorance? Protect transgender students!

Anonymous ,This policy is a grave mistake. ,"I oppose this policy in the strongest possible terms, and I ask that the state rescind this proposal immediately.  Even from the comments already filed on this policy, it's clear the immense threat this policy poses for trans and nonbinary children. If a trans or nonbinary child had a parent who called identifying as LBGTQ+ ""a disease,"" it's unlikely that they are getting the medical care or counseling they need. Further, it is worrisome at best to imagine what it would be like to grow up in an environment that calls something you feel earnestly in your heart ""a disease."" To place the total power of these decisions in the hands of parents, even when doing so is to the clear detriment of the child or against the professional advice of educators, is a grave mistake. Further, this policy if put in place seeks to inflame and incite an issue that requires thoughtful collaboration between parents, educators, medical professionals, counselors and--most importantly--children. These are complicated discussions that often bring conflicting ideas about identity and religion to the fore, and mandating a policy that provides such little space for understanding and collaboration is a mistake.  The state is overstepping its bounds, and in doing so, is declaring that it cares more about those that espouse hate for LBGTQ+ people than it does for the needs of children.",133679,9/26/22  2:47pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133679

Birdy Bird ,Virginias new policies,"I fully support protecting children in all areas until age 21.  Children have no idea what’s best for them. People can’t buy alcohol until age 21 and no one should be allowed to multilateralism their bodies until full age of adulthood. Sexualizing children to fit a narrative is completely wrong. Mostly done by adults, children have no means to reverse these practices later when they have fully matured. I support anyone who is in favor of protecting children from brainwashing, sexualizing, or mutilation.  It should be a crime to even suggest that children do any of these things. children need to be protected by adults. stop brainwashing our kids with CRT, sexualizing, and convincing kids that they are not who they were born to be.

Tony Walker ,TransGender Policy,"First of all, only parents with children enrolled in school should be commenting on this. That is the problem with these controversial school subjects.  Strongly against any school teaching anything without parental views.  Strongly against supporting something that is not even biologically supported in birth.   Tax money pays the schools and teachers to keep their personal opinions out of the school.  People with no children and never had children want to dictate what children need when they are uneducated on what children need.  I am an older parent of 2 small school age children.  Forced to remove children from public school and take on 2 jobs to support the costs.  Simply because the uneducated with personal agendas want to tell my children what they should know.  Basically every school decision the past 30 years has been against everything Christians and people who support Jesus stand for.  Remove people from the school boards that have no children.  We as parents know what is best for our children.  Our salaries are far greater than the teachers and we don't get to senior manager jobs with the largest companies in the world by not being educated.  Check the education level of most public school teachers and board members. See how many have PHD in business, economics, trades that require knowledge.   If I wanted to teach religion in school, I would be arrested or fired.  But if I want to comment on transgender, LBGQT and every other non Christian topic, I am not allowed to have a voice.  Strongly oppose anyone believing they have more education or morals than myself so why have people who are not confident enough in their own born bodies teach my children morals or values.  Majority always wins.  Quit putting the less than 1% minority above the people who successfully have achieved and paid for these schools just to make yourself get recognition.  Any parent who tells their children transgender is OK and to do it, is a poor excuse for a parent.  Absolutely do not support anything related to transgender. ",133761,9/26/22  2:49pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133761

A Public School Parent ,Fully support,As an actual public school parent I fully support this. It is not the duty of the school to keep “secrets” from parents about their children. If a child chooses to identify as something they are afraid to share with their parents or caregivers then the action should be social workers for the home. Makes zero sense to be comfortable having an alternate life and gender with hundreds of peers and staff but not pursue that life at home.

They are not based on any educational evidence or research. They deny the biological reality about the complexity of human sexuality, and deny ALL students the acceptance, respect, and dignity they deserve. Public education should be for all, and those parents who feel otherwise can send their children to a private school or home school.

Hope L. Lawson ,Teachers should NOT be tasked with your agenda,"Teachers are overworked, underpaid, and overwhelmed. Now you want them to call home to snitch if their child wants to be called a nickname or a name other than what is on their birth certificate? WHAT??? How about if we pay teachers to TEACH not to tattle tale to lazy, ignorant parents and the toadies they have elected. What if a family is vegan and a child eats a hotdog at school? Should the teacher make that call home or should it be the lunch lady? What if a child identifies as Catholic at school but their family is Jewish? Who makes that call?? NOBODY - because schools exist to teach our children to be prepared for their lives in the world and they can do and be anything they want in the world. The idea of teacher as classroom police is reductive and, frankly, insane. Let our teachers teach. And keep your disgusting red vest out of Virginia as often as possible.

Anonymous ,Strongly Opposed,"I OPPOSE the draft model policy Gov. Youngkin and VDOE released which discriminates against trans and non-binary students in schools. As a former teacher who had the pleasure of working with students of all kinds--including those who identify as trans or non-binary--and a sister with a transgender brother, it is devastating to see the Commonwealth pursuing policies which would roll back important protections for these vulnerable students. Having a trans-affirming policy is critical to protecting the emotional and physical safety of all students; teaching students and educators about inclusivity, respect, and kindness; and ensuing all students feel accepted and supported in their educational environment. Trans and non-binary students should have the right to exist as their most authentic selves, to represent themselves in an honest way which does not harm any other students, and to feel safe and protected at school--just like all cis-gender students are. I strongly OPPOSE this draft model policy which discriminates against trans and non-binary students.",133840,9/26/22  2:52pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133840

Of course, every student should be treated with respect, but forcing false pronouns, i.e. nonbinary, they/them, hurts our young students and causes confusion.   When our students are out of high school, they can decide for themselves without being forced by teachers or administrators to use pronouns that are clearly incorrect and not biologically supported.   Let parents teach their child(ren) about sexually explicit topics at home, IF THEY SO CHOOSE. Lying to our young children and saying if they are biologically male or female that they can be the other sex, or using non binary pronouns, is lying to our youth and will only cause heartache in the future.

Anonymous ,Fully and strongly oppose ,"Abandoning the model policy promulgated in 2021 for the blatantly discriminatory and bigoted policies here is abhorrent. Far from remedying the promotion of a specific viewpoint (apparently right wing code for treating students with respect) these new policies promote a clearly political and religious viewpoint - misnaming, ill-treating, and outing transgender students. This administration ought to be ashamed itself if it were capable of feeling shame. You want to show kids that you value and respect them? That you will create ""an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying"" in schools?

Should this proposal become policy, you are doing a disservice to every person involved. Not only will trans and non-binary students be at an educational disadvantage by living in a constant state of fear of being “outted” or in a constant state of discomfort since they are not allowed to present as the person they truly are, but you are also missing an opportunity with other students and the teachers. In life, we work with / meet / are around people from all walks of life. We should all learn how to be respectful of others no matter the setting. Teaching this throughout the duration of public schooling will allow students to practice kindness and respect their whole lives, even if they are not receiving those lessons at home. Additionally, this is outside the scope of practice for a teacher/school. Teachers and administrators have no place in such serious and delicate matters as these.

Josh Flaherty ,This is a terrible idea and will harm many students.,"I urge you to not move forward with the proposed changes to how schools treat trans and non-binary students. These are some of our most vulnerable students and they deserve all of the protection we can offer them. Requiring that they be addressed by their birth names and the gender assigned at birth will be demeaning and discriminatory. In many cases, letting parents know about a trans or non-binary student's gender identity or use of a different name will result in real harm coming to these already vulnerable children.  Let's not pretend this will stop with trans and non-binary students. This is a way to discriminate against vulnerable minorities and use hatred to promote a political agenda. Next it will be gay and lesbian students, then religious minorities, political dissidents, and so on.

My mother was a teacher and vice principal at Herndon high school and my father was the director of design and construction in Fairfax County public schools.

It is unconstitutional and it truly shows your true colors. Instead of actually passing policy that MATTERS you decide to be transphobic and put KIDS in danger to bullying and more. Why not give more funding to teachers and schools? Help low income students have access to food/water/resources? Why are you specifically targeting a very small group of kids to terrorize? You are actually making it harder for students and teachers to come to school feeling SAFE. Maybe instead of trying to get the votes of becoming president, actually listen to what NOVA families want. Btw it's not very Christian of you do to this.... honestly Jesus would NEVER do this to anyone and it just shows you're a Christian facist bigot who wants to control people and who wants the votes. I am disgusted by what you have done/are doing and I hope this does not go through. I hope you LISTEN to the comments people are making to you and actually ENACT policy that your constituents want.

Vicki Jimenez ,I applaud you Governor Youngkin!,I applaud you Govenor Youngkin! If we don’t start standing up for what is right then we will lose it. They can color wrong all they like but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s wrong. No wonder our children are confused and our youth’s suicide rate is at an all-time high.We need to get back to our Christian values that this country was founded on. Good has now been called evil and evil is now being called good. What is happened to our country!

Jamie ,Do NOT undermine a parents right. This is a good frame work to start from.,"Government and schools should NOT undermine parental authority. PARENTS should be in control of the beliefs and values of their kids without being set up as the enemy. Parenting is hard enough without other adults interjecting. Most of these children do not possess the skills, knowledge or understanding of what LGBQIT+  means. We are letting peer pressure dictate how and what is being provided to MY child. It is the parents who know there child best and it is their responsibility to show and guide their child into adult hood. We are talking about young impressionable children that by in large have no clue. Now you want an adult in a position of authority to tell them that they must like and follow something that their parents disagree with or find offensive is absurd. I will take it to an extreme but this sure does sound like Charles Manson and the manipulation he did to his followers. Him lets think about that for a while. Who know their child needs best. The PARENT or some government bureaucracy that thinks their ideology is best for your child.",133993,9/26/22  2:56pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=133993

Mandy Lee ,Harmful to students,"This policy will actively harm transgender students, who are already at astronomically high risk for self-harm.  It would be great if we lived in a world where kids could all confide in their parents and be their true selves. But as too many comments here demonstrate, there is a profound lack of understanding of what it means to be transgender, as well as an alarming amount of hostility. Tragically, many trans kids are not safe at home, and school may be their only refuge. Forcing communication where it may not be safe, just to appease a group that casually throws around the word “groomer” any time an adult is invested in the welfare of kids who may not be cisgender, will have a dire impact on an already vulnerable group of kids. Please do not make them any more of a target than they already are. ",134018,9/26/22  2:57pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134018

"Ty Louthan, CCPS Student Teacher ",I Disagree with this Policy,"I am a current student teacher and a future educator in Chesterfield County. This policy goes against every single class, textbook, and professor’s teachings. A strong community is imperative for learning in a school. Students have been proven to not be able to learn the best when the classroom community is not apparent. The basic tenants of a community are respect, kindness and trust. If this policy is put into place, these tenants will be broken and we will not be able to serve trans students in the way that all students need.  The policy’s title is “2022 Model Practices on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents…” This policy goes against its very title.

Not only is respecting someones pronouns, allowing them to use the bathroom that they desire and not being outed constitute basic common decency and human rights, but to suggest otherwise not only endangers an already persecuted minority but also puts anyone else who dares to not fit exactly into restrictive boxes in the firing line too. With rules like these, any child could have their life utterly ruined because they're judged to not conform enough - and if taken further, no-one will ever conform enough. Instead of reducing what little support LGBTQIA+ kids can get in this world and continuing to stir up panics, you should be focusing on the problems that actually matter in this life.

Lindsey Collins ,"Virginia mom opposed to these harmful, transphobic model policies ","As the mom of a future APS student, I’m alarmed by the direction these model policies takes us. School should be a welcoming and safe place for all children, and all children includes trans and LGBTQ+ children.  Trans and LGBTQ+ children are real; they’re not diseased or wrong; they’re beautiful human beings who deserve love and respect just like everyone else. These policies contradict the American Academy of Pediatrics and allow extremist, uneducated, and bigoted parents to control the school system. Governor Youngkin has branded himself as a champion for parents, but what about the parents who oppose transphobia and homophobia? What about the parents who want the schools to follow the American Academy of Pediatrics? What about parents who value diversity and respect for all? What about including the parents of trans and LGBTQ+ children who are support their children’s gender expression? These model policies ignore all of their voices.  Diversity is beautiful, trans children are not scary, and their existence doesn’t threaten anyone else’s. I’m deeply disappointed to see a Virginia go in this direction, and I urge a complete rejection of these backwards rules. ",134087,9/26/22  2:59pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134087

Anonymous ,Irrelevant policy change,"This is a policy that was changed by a bunch of lunkheads that believe that all parents will magically support their children in this life changing decision.  If the child truly believes that their parents will/would support them, they would go to them but now the fear of losing their family, being kicked out of their homes or even put into an institution to “change” the child (which is inherent to their DNA) has altered who they are as people. Trying to fit these individuals into a certain mold only aggravates fear and distrust, not only of transgender individuals, but others that are deemed “different” by those that think they are mainstream. Not all parents are good parents nor do they have all of the correct answers and not all parents like or even live their children, so do you think that is why the child turns to a teacher for “support” and now you’ve ripped that metaphorical rug right out from underneath them.  Not that I believe anything I write will make a difference as this has all the appearance of fake interest, I just really believe this is a jerk move for a small percentage of the population, just to tell yourself you are a upstanding righteous person, so don’t pay yourself on the back. Children will die because of your lack of empathy to gain perceived votes",134100,9/26/22  3:00pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134100
Virginia Resident ,I strongly Oppose this,"These policies are masked as “parent rights” policies. But really they force schools to “out” children who may not feel safe revealing their identities at home. The section stating that school counselors will have to tell parents if students come to their offices to discuss “issues related to gender”, is troubling. Sadly, many children are not fully supported at home by their parents. Some are literally in physical danger at home for expressing themselves authentically. All in all, these proposed school policies provide less ability for kids to be themselves safely in school. This harms ALL children.",134101,9/26/22  3:00pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134101

The source of the opposition is clearly on the side of groomers. They would like to keep things in the darkness from the parents instead of shining light on the things that they are teaching. This will be a long road, but hopefully the people of Virginia are willing to walk it all the way to the end.

Abram ,Compassion + Individual Rights + Informed Parents = A Step in the Right Direction,"There is never a solution to any disagreement or problem that will satisfy all stakeholders or be implemented without fault.  This being the case, the goal of any organization or individual is to accomplish that which, at least in the united states, errs on the side of (1) freedom for each individual, and which, when children are involved, (2) takes into account the responsibility and preferences of the legal guardians assigned to each child.  Guardians exist, be they parents, grandparents, adopted parents, etc, strictly and expressly because our communities have determined that those under guardianship do not possess the clear-thinking maturity and/or experience to make informed decisions on their own.  As these two imperatives are pursued, there is never a time when those seeking them are absolved of hatred, cruelty, or unkindness, it is, however, important to distinguish between the pursuit of the two aforementioned values and hatred.  These values are noble, as they stand both currently and historically supported by both successful outcomes and moral codes around the world.  Hatred, then, would be a separate behavior lacking compassion for an individual or group, but which is accounted for and acutely opposed in this document. For it's value, logically, I support this document.  For it's moral commitment to guardians and to compassion, I support this document.  For it's intent to provide greater freedoms to my fellow residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I support this document.  ",134124,9/26/22  3:00pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134124

Matthew Cross ,Parental Rights Matter ,"To Governor Youngkin, and the VDOE,    I have read Governor Youngkin’s model policy and as a parent of three children, I want to thank the Governor for protecting my rights as a parent and for upholding the Constitution, Virginia Constitution, and Virginia Code. I want my children to attend school to receive an education in reading, writing, & arithmetic, NOT gender ideology! We are a family of faith, and we are very accepting of others, because we follow the “golden rule”, but our faith can not affirm what we consider against Gods Word. The model policy protects my rights as a parent and it protects students who are transgender. It causes the schools to partner with parents and not to hide information from parents. I understand this is going to be a fight for the Governor’s team, but I appreciate the willingness to fight for we the people/parents. I’m also thankful to the team for following the law. If citizens can not change their names without a judge signing official documents, and if a police officer can also charge my son for  giving a false identity, why should the law change when they attend public schools? I am 100% in favor of the 2022 Model Policies, Thank You   Matthew W.

Claire Q ,This legislation will harm transgender AND cisgender children,"This will gravely harm not just transgender children, but all of our children. Every time legislation impacting transgender children is passed, it inadvertently affects cisgender children as well. An unexpected consequence of states banning transgender children from sports has been that cisgender children in those states are also sometimes subject to invasive gender inspection. Cisgender children in Virginia are also going to get caught up in this legislation in some obvious ways-at least a handful of cisgender children will be mislabeled as trans by their educators and reported to abusive parents-but the full impact of the harm this legislation causes all Virginia students will only become apparent a year or so after the legislation has been rolled out. That said, refraining from passing this legislation for the safety of transgender children should be enough. I am transgender, and I went to school long enough ago that almost no one was out. It was horrible, and many of the trans kids were incredibly depressed because they were unable to be themselves. In high school I knew several kids who cut themselves because the pain of cutting lessened the pain of not being able to live as their gender. This included a straight, cisgender boy who many students thought was trans, and who spent all his time with the trans kids to avoid his tormentors. The one student I knew who was out used they/them pronouns, and many of the students bullied them by calling them ""it"". They were unable to use the bathroom at school (I don't know how they got through the day, but it must have made it hard to learn!), and during lunch and free periods, they hid in the art room so other children couldn't harm them. The bullying by students was subtly encouraged by teachers who didn't use their pronouns, and who would argue with them about it in class. There were times when I thought this student might kill themselves because of the hardships they faced. When things began to change for transgender children, I was delighted. It made such a massive difference in transgender students' mental and physical health, and led to a decrease in bullying. Seeing my neighbors' children confident in themselves and their gender was incredibly heartening. (As an aside, none of the bullying stopped these children from being trans. It just gave them mental health problems, led them to use drugs to cope, and made them stop caring about doing well in school. As soon as these children graduated and it was safe to do so, they came out as trans.) This legislation is truly a step backwards for human rights. If this is rolled out, thousands upon thousands of children across the state will return to living in fear of being outed, to feeling terrified of the idea of going to school, to being viciously bullied in a school system that supports their oppression. You will, in a tangible, measurable way, be responsible for the upticks in child suicide that this bill causes, as well as any deaths by violence these children face because you have cultivated an environment where hatred is encouraged. I strongly oppose this bill, and the harm-both everyday and fatal-it will cause trans and cisgender children.",134229,9/26/22  3:04pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134229

Dakota Saunders ,Strongly Oppose - Stop Scapegoating Trans Youth,"I’m a Virginia resident, voter, and a part of the LGBT community. I strongly oppose this policy proposed by Governor Youngkin and call on the VDOE to reject it. I was disgusted to hear that instead of focusing on actual solutions to improve our public education, our elected officials are actively going after trans students. This policy requiring teachers and school staff to out trans/non-binary students, restricting their ability to use restrooms and participate in school sports, and prohibiting staff from using affirming names and pronouns will do nothing to benefit existing students, family, or staff. It will not raise test scores or demonstrate improvements in academic achievement. It will only harm trans youth. Trans students pose no threat to their peers' learning. They just want to exist and receive the same level of education, respect, and safety that we would ensure any other student had, so stop using them as scapegoats. This legislation is profoundly discriminatory and any time spent on it is an enormous waste of taxpayer money. If you're really that pressed about the state of our public education, try appropriately funding schools and districts so that teachers don't have to pay out of pocket for classroom materials. Or paying public school teachers (including early childhood teachers) a living wage. You could work with high schools and colleges to attract and train new teachers to combat staff shortages and high student:teacher ratios that limit teaching effectiveness. Provide counselling and mental health services for kids who have lost family and friends to COVID and are experiencing social emotional issues that are disrupting their learning. Or really do anything of actual benefit to our educational system instead of bullying kids.",134233,9/26/22  3:04pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134233

Marie ,This would harm so many children and benefit no one,"Transgender people deserve to be referred to how they want to, just like any other human being. Using pronouns for someone that you might not expect you’d use isn’t going to harm anyone so removing this right is not only targeted discrimination but also just incredibly pointless. Transgender students also should use the bathrooms that correlate with their gender identity - evidence shows that they are far more subject to things like sexual abuse  when forced in bathrooms that don’t match this; as for the converse, there is little to no evidence of transgender people posing a threat to other members within the bathroom that matches their gender. Allowing everyone to feel comfortable with themselves and express themselves how they want is a massive benefit to both trans and cis people, and comes at a disadvantage to no one.",134290,9/26/22  3:06pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134290

Parents/guardians play an important role in many children’s education, but school needs to be a safe space for children to be able to express themselves.

And treating sexual deviance as acceptable and normal ... and the seemingly attractive trend is just evil.  What are we thinking? We need to continue to be strong patriotic Americans and not slide towards socialist principles. And regardless of a student's beliefs, they need to be protected from discrimination and bullying .. be they non-heterosexual or Christian.

Anonymous ,I STRONGLY OPPOSE the proposed model policy,"As an educator and a family member and friend to transgender people, I STRONGLY OPPOSE the governor's guidance on the treatment of transgender and nonbinary youth in schools. I am a professor at VCU and a parent of a child in Richmond Public Schools. It is imperative that our schools be safe and welcoming environments for ALL of our children. In addition, our schools should be places where our children come together to learn from each other--to celebrate difference and find solidarity. In contrast, the governor's policy is rooted in transphobia and seeks to further harm trans and nonbinary kids. His policy seeks to erase trans and nonbinary youth from the classroom, creating a hostile & potentially dangerous school environment. Indeed, the Trevor Project’s 2022 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health found that 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half (53%) of transgender and nonbinary youth. Nearly 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youth attempted suicide. However, LGBTQ youth who had access to an LGBTQ-affirming school reported lower rates of attempting suicide than those who did not. Additionally, learning about LGBTQ people or issues was associated with significantly lower odds (23%) of a past-year suicide attempt in LGBTQ students. The governor claims to be acting on behalf of parents, and yet he is proposing a policy that would actively create school environments that could cause grave harm to our children. I urge the governor to consider guidance that would create safe and supportive learning environment free from discrimination and harassment for all students.",134415,9/26/22  3:09pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134415

Ian Fernander ,I completely oppose this. Protect and uplift the lives of trans kids. ,"Every day, throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia, educators and school leaders work to ensure that all students have an opportunity to receive a high-quality education. As a part of that work, educators strive to meet the individual needs of all students entrusted to their care, and teachers work to create educational environments where all students thrive. The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students. The Department also fully acknowledges the rights of parents to exercise their fundamental rights granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children. The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents to determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is essential to improving outcomes for all children in Virginia. The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological belief. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or religious beliefs. The Department embarked on a thorough review of the Model Policies Guidance adopted on March 4, 2021 (the “2021 Model Policies”). The 2021 Model Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools. The 2021 Model Policies also disregarded the rights of parents and ignored other legal and constitutional principles that significantly impact how schools educate students, including transgender students. With the publication of these 2022 Model Policies (the “2022 Model Policies”), the Department hereby withdraws the 2021 Model Policies, which shall have no further force and effect. The Department issues the 2022 Model Policies to provide clear, accurate, and useful guidance to Virginia school boards that align with statutory provisions governing the Model Policies. See Code of Virginia, § 22.1-23.3 (the “Act”). Significantly, the 2022 Model Policies also consider over 9,000 comments submitted to the Department during the public comment period for the 2021 Model Policies.",134419,9/26/22  3:09pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134419

Megan Ramage ,Please reconsider! Virginia does not support Youngkin,Once again Youngkin is pushing his own agenda and not acting in the best interest of Virginians. This law if enacted would put hundreds if not thousands of children at risk. Gen Z children are one thousand times more accepting than older generations and fully support the LGBTQ+ community. I have witnessed them making their own efforts to ask for peoples pronouns and making space for families without the traditional mother and father figure. The only people who support this are boomers and individuals who haven’t had formal education in 30+ years. This would directly contribute to harm against LGBTQ+ children by forcing school personnel to “out” students and likely also an increase in suicide which is already at a very high percentage for LGBTQ+ individuals. Please Youngkin stop pushing your own traditional Christian views… this is NOT a theocracy.

Anonymous ,100% FOR this policy,"This policy brings assemblance of normalcy back into the public school system.  Under no circumstances should any child feel threatened, bullied or diminished in school.  However, there are already laws and rules and policies existing that protect any student from such occurrences listed above.  Under no circumstances is it ever okay for a biological boy to decide on his own that he wants to go into the girls bathroom or locker room.  Biological boys should not be allowed to play in girls sports.  And no one in America can compel speech.  Forcing someone to use made up pronouns violates the first amendment of the US Constitution.  If a person chooses to use someone's""preferred pronouns"" then they can do so of their own volition.  If they choose not to, they are exercising their right to free speech and no punitive measures should be placed upon anyone for it.  I for one will never call an individual ""they"".  ",134441,9/26/22  3:10pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134441

Kylie Beauregard ,Vile attempt to politicize and endanger children,"This is a dangerous and disgusting attempt to undermine children’s safety, all in the name of whipping up partisan furor to feed your political ambition. There is no legal or statistical basis for this change in standards and, in fact, you would be needlessly spending taxpayer money to defend it as it is clearly illegal per current federal and state law. As a parent whose child is about to enter K-12 public education for the 2023-2024 school year, I am appalled and enraged that you are endangering and undermining my child’s physical and mental heath for a political stunt to float your run for 2024.

A. Concerned Parent ,Stop pushing Trans ideology in schools!! Schools are for education not social justice!!,"Please get wokeness out of public schools. Our youth are the future of our country and the public school system has reduced education to social justice training. Our math, science and basic curriculum has been replaced with Marxist divisive instruction. We are being told racism is all white peoples fault, conservatives are extremists when the facts are kids love and accept other kids until an adult teaches them otherwise. Race is irrelevant now but this gender confusion is causing real issues. One day a child feels like a boy, next week a girl, and our children are expected to understand this and tiptoe around their feelings… My sons entire class was told they must to use preferred pronouns in his school last month by a resource officer during their lunch break. She used a megaphone and stated preferred pronouns are required or those choosing not to recognize preferred pronouns are bullying students… what??? how is it not bullying to have boys dressed as girls and going into girls bathrooms?  Kids go there to learn math, science, English and other needed skills, this is becoming a clown show on taxpayers dime. Several confused kids think they are cats or dogs now so where does this stop???? Enough is Enough, people have tried to accept alternative lifestyles but now it’s evolving into complete mental incapacitation with no end in sight. There are only male and female genders, save the majority of our kids before the handful of mentally ill corrupt them all!!    ",134445,9/26/22  3:10pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134445

JJ Medina ,I strongly oppose this policy,"This policy is dangerous and targets the already vulnerable population of non-binary and trans students who are just trying to survive. The draft policy gives way too much room to allow student to be mistreated and put in danger. All research shows that having one affirming adult in their life can make the difference in whether a child chooses to continue living. Taking away a teachers ability to be that adult is a tragedy. Further, forcing teachers to out kids to parents when they do not know if it will lead to real harm is so dangerous. I am a trans, non-binary person. I did not come out as queer until I was out of the house and financially independent because I truly feared that I would be kicked out or subject to other harm. Taking that choice away from an individual is wrong and goes against all the data that is available.

Though it claims to be centered on ‘parental rights’, it neglects and devalues the interests of parents who raise their children to respect and value others’ differences. It is a purported solution to a problem that does not exist. By focusing only on the parents who are opposed to even doing the bare minimum to accommodate trans kids (I’d argue that facts like trans people exist and deserve a public education can’t really be opposed) completely undermines the argument that it’s a ‘parental rights’ issue. What about the parental rights of those who do value all kids, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation? These are public schools and are supposed to serve all Virginians, including trans kids and their parents. Those who disagree can choose to attend private schools or homeschool their kids. Let’s call this draft policy what it is: a way to draw national attention to this governor, so that he can better position himself for a 2024 POTUS run. Figure out a different way to make a national splash, Governor; leave Virginia’s kids alone to grow and learn.

Anonymous ," SUPPORT due to lack of evidenced based outcomes for ""affirmation""","I fully support this policy. As a parent and licensed mental health professional with children I find it concerning that children are allowed to self diagnose with gender dysphoria with little to no exploration of what may be causing it. I find it appalling that adults would tell a child anything other than they are beautiful and perfect the way they are. No child should be told they need a medicalized intervention to feel happy and whole. That is not body positive. Gender identity is often based on stereotypes of what boys and girls should be like. Much of the research coming out of Europe now sees that ""affirmation"" causes more harm without the proper guidance. The standards of care are based on flawed data pushed by activists. It is a myth that trans youth will die by suicide if not affirmed. The study most ppl reference did not look at actual attempts- only suicidal ideation. It also did not take into account that many of the trans youth in the study also had comorbid depression. When taken into account the rates of suicidal ideation among the ""trans"" group and non trans youth with depression, the rates were not different. Most mental health professionals will tell you that the agent of change in families is the caregiver. If a child is asking to be identified differently at school than at home- that is a problem that needs to be addressed in family therapy. It is normal for teens in their stage of development to try on different identities, it is not normal for other adults to collude with the teen to hide that from parents. Please look at de transitioner's stories.  Most importantly- women are a protected class based on sex. If being a women/female is some abstract concept of a feeling and we can't define a women, then how can we protect women? The feelings of a trans woman are not more important than the safety and dignity of girls. Why are trans women not fighting for their own separate spaces? The womens restroom does not exist to validate trans women. I ask anyone who says they do not support this- if you saw a male follow a little girl into a public bathroom would you go check on the child? I know I would, but activists want us to blindly accept that any male going into a protected women's space belongs there and is safe. Unfortunately that is not the reality we live in. ",134543,9/26/22  3:13pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134543

Concerned Virginia Parent ,These laws will allow bullying and protect the bullies,"These “Model” laws will only serve to allow bullying of an already vulnerable and bullied subset of Children and will protect the bullies. It is entirely unnecessary and both statistics and anecdotal evidence prove that kids in LGBTQ+ spectrum are a threat to no one and are in fact the threatened population. These rules will in no way better or encourage quality education and will in fact impede providing education to the whole community of public school students. Bullying and intimidation impede conducive learning environments, that IS proven.  It’s clear the Youngkin administration has no intention of bettering education in Virginia and only hope to score political points by foresaking children and feeding conspiracy theories rather than serving the whole of Virginia’s constituents. This is a “solution” to a problem which doesn’t exist and rolls back protections that dissuades bullying, which is an ACTUAL problem.",134555,9/26/22  3:14pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134555

Anons ,Warhill High School does NOT support,"Within the Williamsburg James City County, the schools within these districts do not support these oppressive and harmful propositions.  Make no mistakes, these are not parental rights, this is anti-queer at the base. These policies hurt most for those in high school, who are close to adulthood and are transitioning to the real world. The world where, yes, is harsh, however should be be feared on being killed.  That is what these policies do. Forced outing kids, forced deadnaming, forced misgendering, causing students to feel more suffocated and like there is no safe place for them. Home life is not always accepting, trusting, or ready to come to terms with a kid who may not be cis. The option to tell parents, if ever, should be on the student, not anyone else. The risk of being kicked out, being disowned, even killed with some more violent parents, is too dangerous to ignore.    The fear that parents who support these policies have are derived from misinformation. Thinking that hormones, surgeries, and the such, are given to children. They are not. Social transitioning is typically what is done before the age of consent, being 16 for sex, driver's licenses, jobs, and more. If a teenager can get a job, and learn to drive, they can make the choice to be on hormones. Which, by the way, is the age they can start HRT - or also known as hormone replacement therapy.  Another misconception is puberty blockers, which have been used by cis and trans kids enough to have proven to be safe.  Harvard and many other schools, including some government websites, have done active research on the act of gender v sex, and how transgender individuals align with biology that is more advanced than high school.    Understanding that queer people deserve privacy and a choice is important. It's not anti-parent rights to think so, it's pro-student choice. ",134587,9/26/22  3:15pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134587

Bruce D. Rieder ,Proposed policy violates religious faith,"My Unitarian Universalist faith affirms as its first principle the inherent worth and dignity of every person. The proposed policy on transgender students in Virginia schools violates that practical moral principle. Every transgender student is a natural person with the inalienable dignity of individual agency and a right to privacy which is denied them in this proposed policy. Each of these transgender person’s worth is inherent to their person, not residing in the mind of, or under force of control by, another person, even a parent. The policy treats transgender students as empty vessels without thought or self-awareness and completely subject to the control of parents in all things. This is plainly a dysfunctional and abusive family model, devoid of any recognition of the science of human development. This mistreatment of people in childhood results in adults who bring this dysfunction to societal interactions.  As a matter of conscience, I cannot support this morally reprehensible and wholly impractical policy. I am, in addition, compelled to resist its implementation and will support legal action to challenge the constitutionality of this policy which I believe to be in violation of the first and 14th amendments at a minimum. The DOE already well knows that portions of its proposed policy is at least unconstitutional under Grimm v Gloucester. As a gay cis-gender male Virginian for more than 45 years I can speak from personal experience to the harm that policy proposals like this cause to individuals. I have endured the legal attack on my marriage to my husband of 37 years by the Commonwealth. It matters little that after years of litigation, these egregious offenses to the equality of some Virginians were eventually declared federally unconstitutional. The harm was done when the policy was proposed and implemented, and I can attest that it is long standing. Indeed, to this day, a vocal minority in the Commonwealth persist in hateful misinformation to attempt to restore the discrimination against my family.  I grieve today for transgender, non-binary, intersex and, indeed, for all LGBTQIA children in Virginia that, as children, they are called upon to deal with the harm of this proposal having been made and the inevitable hateful and dehumanizing public discourse that arises. If transgender students can be called out for punitive treatment under the guise of legal policy, any LGBTQIA student is exposed to a similar tactic, and they all realize this. I had trouble enough processing the hate directed toward me as an adult with a fully formed support network; I cannot imagine the pain being experienced today by LGBTQIA youth who may be isolated not yet having found the words to describe their personhood or self-advocacy. I grieve for supportive families of LGBTQIA children who are losing the assistance of their child’s school in navigating their way through this family dynamic. The fact is that no Virginian was harmed by the existing policy for the respectful treatment of transgender students. This proposed policy is causing great harm and seems intended to do so. The moral path for the DOE, in my view, is to immediately rescind this proposal and to apologize to all of those Virginians, whether children or adults, that they have harmed by publishing this proposed policy without consultation or apparent attention to ample evidence of the harm. I will stand on the side of love in affirming the inherent worth and dignity of all people and in firm opposition to this proposed policy.",134595,9/26/22  3:15pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134595

Fairfax County Student ,Horrible policy ,"As a student who is trans and out, taking away the right and comfort to LGBTQ students will be detrimental to the well being of said students. Being at school is often the ONLY place a trans and LGBTQ student can be themselves and by actively taking that away YOU are the one who will be killing the kids. The protections FCPS schools give their students is often the only thing that makes me and hundreds of other students comfortable and makes a safe and fun learning environment. I firmly believe that passing this policy will get students killed and lead to worse academic performance. By caring more about the parents. The ones who ARE NOT AT THE SCHOOL LEARNING you are adding to the oppression of LGBTQ students.  It was found in a 2015 a study in the Journal of Adolescent Healthcare that trans students are at much higher risks of developing depression, anxiety, and self harming tendencies. 50% of trans kids are at risk of being diagnosed with depression, 26.7% suffer from anxiety, 17.2% HAVE ATTEMPTED SUICIDE, and 16.7% have engaged in self harming activities with intent to harm themselves.I will stand by saying that this is policy will spread hate, will kill kids, and will add to the bullying LGBTQ kids will face.

Marcus ,Pretty words for veiling discrimination; strongly oppose,"This policy hides behind bad faith arguments of parental rights and religious freedoms as a way to push government into schools and households to strip people of individual liberty and choice. If we are talking about religious freedoms, choosing to protect one's right to discriminate because their faith does not ""believe"" what someone else chooses for themselves, then the government has actively chosen to protect one group's beliefs over another, which is unconstitutional under the First Amendment as the government should not be prioritizing one faith over another so that everyone is equal under the law, and moreover, in the education that they are able to achieve. Under a parental rights argument, again, the state is now taking away individual liberties to prefer one select group over another. Transgender students are just trying to go to school and learn. Those against that are actively discriminating and interjecting in a person's or parent's ability to choose for themselves or their child; and yet, the policy would give preference to those who interfere with other people's lives and diminish their right of self. It is hard to rationalize the argument of individual choice and then utilize the state to strip people of their autonomy over themselves and their identity.  ",134663,9/26/22  3:18pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134663

Julie Perry ,Strongly Support ,"       I am a Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) teacher that supports the VDOE new 2022 model polices for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools. As a Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) teacher, I have concerns about FCPS Regulation 2603, Gender-expansive and Transgender Students, which models former Governor Ralph Northam’s VDOE 2021 model polices for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia Public Schools that are very harmful to ALL students, parents, and teachers.         The 2021 VDOE model polices put student’s safety as risk because they allow students to use the bathroom of the gender that they identify with. That is what caused that girl to get raped on May 28, 2021, at Stone Bridge High School in Loudoun County. This has also caused some of my female students to ask me if they can use a one stall bathroom that I have to unlock because they feel unsafe and uncomfortable with their male peers being able to use the same locker room and restroom as them. I have also had female students not use the bathroom at school because they don’t feel safe, which can cause girls to get Urinary Tract Infections (UTI).      Another reason the 2021 VDOE model policies are harmful is because they force teachers to lie to some of their students about their gender. As a teacher who teaches in a Virginia Public School, this goes against my Christian Principles and violates my first amendment right of the Freedom of Religion. Also, lying to students about their gender only harms them because students that struggle with gender dysphoria, are struggling many with many other factors in their life and desperately need the love and care of their parents, teachers, other school staff for support that will help overcome their struggles. Since gender dysphoria is usually a phase during the pre and early adolescence years, only a small minority of children who experience cross-gender identification will continue to do so into late adolescence or adulthood.       Finally, the 2021 VDOE model policies violate parental rights because I am not obligated to tell a student’s parents if their child wants me to call them a different name and gender than what is in the school data base system. This violates Virginia Law that says, “a parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent’s child”. None of my concerns about the 2021 VDOE model polices make me anti-Transgender. I love all my students regardless of the religion, ethnicity, gender, race, and political affiliation. All my concerns are about the safety and well-being of Virginia students and the rights of parents and teachers, which is why I feel the need to share my concerns.       Therefore, I strongly support the VDOE new 2022 model polices for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools. They will keep ALL students much safer in school and protect the rights of parents and teachers.",134670,9/26/22  3:18pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134670

Patty Smith Appomattox Regional Governor's School ,This policy HARMS students! ,"I am writing to express my serious disagreement with this new trans student policy. First of all, as a member of the Governor's LGBTQ+ Advisory Board, this policy goes against everything we on the Education Committee are advising him to do. As an educator with 36 years of teaching experience, this policy also goes against everything I know to be true about caring for and educating ALL students. No one has a guaranteed Constitutional right to bully or harass other students -- and dead-naming or misgendering them is doing exactly that. Furthermore, asking students and teachers to use a chosen name and pronouns is NOT forcing them to accept anything with which they disagree.  Forcing teachers and schools to ""out"" students to their parents puts students' lives at risk. My obligation is to care for and teach my students. Trans students are far more vulnerable and more likely to commit suicide than their cis-gender peers. Please educate yourselves about the very real risks many trans students face in school daily. If you care at all about children and education, you will rescind this policy immediately. ",134678,9/26/22  3:18pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134678

These objectively cruel proposed policies make school less safe, and less successful, to our trans and LGBTQ+ students, targeting trans students for political points and treating all children as the property of parents and not human beings with agency and identities of their own. The original model policies brought harm to no one while affording protections -- both symbolic and real -- to some of our most vulnerable young people. The youngkin administration's proposed policies give cover to bullying, misnaming, and erasure of young people. These policies reflect no empathy or care for our students, adopting instead an understanding of young people only as extensions of their legal guardians and inscribing as a policy of the state a binary definition of gender that ignores the full human history and increasing evidence of human flourishing.",134679,9/26/22  3:18pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134679

Anonymous ,"Protect and support transgender kids, don't attack them","It is tragic that Gavin Grimm had to spend so much of his high-school and later years battling a local Virginia school board for the right to use a boys bathroom. I have always looked up to him as a modern-day civil rights hero, so that no other boy would have to endure what he went through. Now you want to take his achievements and throw them in the trash. How can the Youngkin administration turn its back on Virginia's transgender youth, who are among our most vulnerable population groups? Why would any corporation wish to come to Virginia -- and why won't major corporate headquarters, including Amazon, leave -- given this heartless change? I'm sure the administration is aware that bathrooms can be a source of discomfort or worse for trans kids if they are forced into a bathroom where it appears they do not belong -- for example, if a trans child who is a boy is forced by your rules into a girls bathroom not once, but every single day, simply because of the gender he was identified with at birth. You wish to inflict an inappropriate, risky, highly volatile situation on every transgender child, not once, but multiple times every single day, overriding even the policies of inclusive, supportive school systems that wish to create a positive, safe learning environment for all students, including transgender students. This is not how we treat fellow Virginians of any age. Your plans also include the demand to deadname children and teenagers with names they may not have used for years, which do not reflect their gender, and to avoid using the pronouns which they ask others to use, all in an attempt to break down their mental health, their sense of legitimate personal autonomy, their sense of self-worth, and their ability to acknowledge the gender they identify with. I'm sure you are well aware of the level of suicidal impulses and homelessness among LGBTQ youth. However, it seems as though you hope to make those trends worse instead of better.  Transgender identity should be accommodated in school with reasonable policies, rather than by these extreme, 180-degree reversals from the past, which are aimed at transitioning from day-to-day support and care for such students in many Virginia schools to state-advocated antagonism and bigotry. Your shocking proposed policies also set a shameful model for non-transgender youth to follow (or, I hope, recoil from) as well. They would do great harm. Please revisit this issue and do not make these changes.",134709,9/26/22  3:20pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134709

Laura Adler ,I oppose this for so many reasons,"In addition to the harm will cause to trans kids, I also think this guidance is just too much to ask of our teachers, who work very hard and should be able to focus on teaching kids and not policing them according to all their parents' ideologies. What's next, forcing teachers to call a parent if a student displays an interest in a religion other than their parents? Trans kids just want to go to school and be themselves. Kids today have been raised to believe they don't have to hide who they are anymore, and they are not going back. They are not going to stop being trans just because teachers are forced to out them to their parents. Trying to enlist teachers in this futile effort is just putting an undue burden on them for nothing, and harming trans kids in the process. Also, this guidance legitimizes the baseless accusations that school staff are pushing gender non-conformity on kids, forcing treatment on them without parents' consent, and using LGBTQ+ discussions to initiate sexual abuse. This is not happening, and it's not OK to make accusations like this without evidence. People saying this are part of a tiny, crazy minority, spurred on by activist who aren't even local. They should not be indulged by our government. Support trans kids and support our teachers.",134717,9/26/22  3:20pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134717

Anonymous ,I support the bill. Full speed ahead.,"Those who oppose the bill are a danger to children, who are willingly leaving children open to attack from sexual preditors that play the system to their advantage and choose to identify as a different gender to be able to prey on kids in bathrooms, as we saw in Loudin. This nonsense has to stop, so to is mandating the use of gender pronouns. Being that gender dysphoria is a specific type of mental illness listed in the DSM-5, we shouldn't be promoting mental illness, nor placating the mentally ill. We need to be promoting more therapy and access to such for transgenders, especially since they have the highest suicide rate out of any social demographic.

The reality is that trans and non-binary people (including children) exist. This fact is not going to change based on the guidance, but what will change would be their rights to safety and privacy.

It’s awfully bold of this administration to try to invoke the 14th Amendment in support of this nonsense, as protections for transgender students in public schools should absolutely fall under the Equal Protection Clause (see Glenn v. Brumby, 2011). It’s unsurprising that Gov. Youngkin’s administration would choose to willingly misinterpret the intent of the 14th, as he (and his party) seem to fundamentally disagree with Section 3 as well.

Cecelia Parks ,Strongly oppose,"The proposed changes to VA DOE policy on transgender and nonbinary students are dangerous and harmful and should not be implemented. Children will die if this policy is implemented due to the unsafe conditions it creates. Defining transgender students as students ""whose parent has requested in writing, due to their child’s persistent and sincere belief that his or her gender differs with his or her sex, that their child be so identified while at school"" completely ignores the reality that many transgender and nonbinary students face: that their parents do not accept them for who they are, and that school is one of the few places they could feel safe and accepted for their gender identity. This proposed policy would rip that safety away from them. It is equally dangerous for schools to out transgender and nonbinary students to their parents, as that may create an unsafe environment for the students at home. The proposed policy is clearly a stunt from an administration trying to score conservative political points without any regard for the safety of the students they purportedly are trying to protect. If anyone in the administration had spoken with a transgender or nonbinary person while crafting this proposed policy, they would have quickly learned that this is the opposite of what transgender and nonbinary students and adults want and what is safe for them. I strongly oppose the proposed policy and encourage the administration to adhere to the March 2021 Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools.",134778,9/26/22  3:22pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134778

Monica Holtz ,I oppose this policy,"Schools exposing students as transgender to their families has the potential to inflict unnecessary and avoidable emotional or physical harm to students. As determined by Sterling v. Borough of Minersville, school personnel cannot 'out' students to their families, or expose them as being LGBT. Some students may feel unsafe in their homes if their families find out about their sexuality or gender identity. Additionally, there are school personnel who are bound by confidentiality when students share certain information with us. We are only allowed to break this confidentiality in certain instances, and sharing their sexuality or gender identity does not fall under one of the exceptions to confidentiality. Because of this, I do not believe we can be expected to comply with this policy. If a student shares with me that they are transgender, and this is not something they have shared with their family, it would be unethical and illegal for me to break that confidentiality and trust with the student and tell their family without the student's consent. ",134784,9/26/22  3:23pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134784

"Jordan Westcott, Virginia Tech ",Opposition to the 2022 Model Policies Due to Potential Harm to Students,"My name is Jordan Westcott, MS, NCC, and I am a Counselor Education Ph.D. Candidate with expertise in LGBTQIA+ health and wellness. I am writing to oppose the 2022 Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools as they are currently written. Specifically, I am concerned about the requirement to use a student’s legal name and sex assigned at birth, as well as schools not changing student names and sex assigned at birth in school records even with parental support. There is evidence that when students are not affirmed in their gender identity, they experience worse mental health outcomes (GLSEN, 2016). Policies requiring misgendering students or outing them to potentially unsupportive families increase the negative environment which may contribute to poorer mental health outcomes. I am also concerned about the components of the policy that requires students to use bathroom associate with their sex assigned at birth, regardless of gender presentation or identity. Transgender students often avoid using the bathroom altogether when they cannot use bathroom associated with their gender identity, which increases risk of serious health complications (GLSEN, 2016). Additionally, transgender students are more likely to be victimized when they attempt to use a bathroom associated with their sex assigned at birth, which may increase exposure to trauma and ultimately lead to worse mental health outcomes. Furthermore, requiring students to play on sports teams associated with their sex assigned at birth may force many transgender students not to participate in sports at all, which are important prosocial activities that enhance relationships and wellbeing. In sum, this policy is dangerous for transgender students. Although the policy aims to center parental rights to determine how their children are raised, much of the policy forces students to experience a school environment that is unsupportive regardless of parents’ wishes. By requiring students to use the bathroom associated with their sex assigned at birth, even when parents support transition, the school is actively going against what parents want for their children. Furthermore, by outing children to their parents, this policy increases risk of exposure to child abuse. Although the policy claims to share this information so that parents understand what the school is doing with their children, this actually forces outing, which can expose children to familial rejection, physical and emotional abuse, and even homelessness. Instead, I would encourage the policies to align more closely with the 2021 Model Policies, which centered student safety. Allowing transgender students to have access to bathrooms that align with their gender identity and expression creates a safer school environment. Additionally, enforcing anti-bullying policies that protect transgender students would create a more supportive school environment. By allowing students to explore who they are in safe environments in schools, the old policies better protected all students and their wellbeing. If you have questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me. Again, I oppose the 2022 Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools  as currently written and urge revisions that center student safety and wellbeing, as described above.",134797,9/26/22  3:23pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134797

I grew up in Virginia and as a tomboyish girl, was frequently yelled at in school bathrooms by people who were either confused or were being intentionally cruel. These sorts of responses will escalate under the proposed for trans, nonbinary, and non gender conforming students. The government is effectively encouraging bullying. -damage student achievement by creating distraction for all students and a deeply uncomfortable and cruel learning environment for LGBT+ youth. Students can't learn when they hate themselves or their teachers, they can't learn if their peers are being empowered to be cruel to them, and they can't learn if they don't feel safe. -expose Virginia to costly and damaging lawsuits because of the illegality of the policy under Virginia and federal law and the likelihood that these policies will cause irreparable emotional and psychological harm, including encouraging suicides.   Please rescind this policy and return to the previous Northam administration policy for educational guidelines related to trans/GNF students.",134828,9/26/22  3:24pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134828

Connor Wilson ,Trans rights are human rights. ,"I strongly oppose this bill. Those that are questioning there gender at this age are simply figuring out who they are. And this is an important thing for a child. If they are old enough to know there own gender there old enough to decide otherwise. Like it or not. I have heard excuses that gender is not a social construct. Sure but what is a social construct is the belief that identitying as the other gender is wrong, going through the physical changes, believing that this children shouldn't be given this chance us also a social construct. I genuinely believe that kinds through elementary, middle or high school can decide there gender at least. What I I will say is maybe allowing them to go through certain changes like hormonal or testosterone build up at such a young age might be questionable. These can go wrong and present certain behavior issues. But otherwise this bill is a bad idea. Another thing is a lot of people think that allowing kids to decide there own genders is responsible for the newer age making them more emotional, one kids are emotional there younger, two that is more of an issue from vaping this would have such negative mental effects. Also so would schools given parents too much power may often make kids more powerful or the fact that the lack of safety brought by the lack of gun controls can be quite the scary concept. These emotions also come from family issues back at home. Not being raised appropriately not being given the love and the necessary attention. And the lack of support for those with mental issues. Gender conformity is irrelevant to this discussion and getting rid of it will do nothing. Know the actual problems and destroy those. All this bill will cause is more damage. ",134876,9/26/22  3:26pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134876

Sophia Ross ,This Will Harm Children,"This anti-transgender policy will cause irreparable harm to children and their families. School should be a place where ALL children are welcomed, regardless of their differences, and Gov. Youngkin's proposal will only cause more discrimination toward children who may already be struggling. We know that 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youth have attempted suicide in the last year, and that these numbers will continue to grow if children and teenagers are not given safe spaces in which they can freely express themselves. I also want to state that this is a cowardly political move. Political because Youngkin is using the current panic around transgender and otherwise LGBTQIA students to propel his own career, and cowardly because he is putting real children in harm's way as a result. Whether you are affirming or not of LGBTQIA issues, I would hope that all Virginians consider themselves pro-children. This policy is not pro-children, it is pro-Youngkin, and pro-fear. No one has any reason to be afraid of a transgender or nonbinary person, whether or not they are children, simply because of their gender identity. If you find yourself feeling fear around this issue, please take the time to learn more about the science behind this identity, and especially the effect that discrimination has upon children and young adults. An alive, queer child will always be better than a dead child. Please, PLEASE consider these children, and think about why Youngkin and his colleagues want you to be afraid of them. ",134916,9/26/22  3:28pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134916

Alayna Roman ,I oppose the guidance and urge the VDOE to reject them,"If you're a man, imagine that everyone around you calls you Sue. You feel uncomfortable with your name and don't identify with it in your own mind. It is difficult for you to hear people call you Sue. You understand that your family gave you this name, so you don't want to be disrespectful to them and you think you'll never tell them how much you actually dislike the name. You are trying to understand what name feels better, so you ask your friends to call you Stew. You ask them to refer to you with he/him/his pronouns and you try it out. You find that you feel comfortable with the name Stew and how your friends are referring to you, so you start to ask a few teachers (at first) to call you this name as well. You know at this point, though, that you're not ready to have this big conversation with your parents who might not react as well as your friends have. If you're a woman reading this, then switch up Stew and Sue while reading it. What would have happened if your parents were told about what happened that day in school when you asked teachers to call you Stew? Knowing your own parents and their religious affiliation, how would they have reacted? Some parents might be accepting and be sure their children get the care they need, but others might react negatively, tell their child that they're being disrespectful, or even become violent. While children are trying to understand who they are (as all children try to do), transgender and non-binary youth will not be given the option to explore their own identities if this policy goes through. I understand that it can be confusing for those who have not witnessed the transition of someone close to them or gone through their own transition, but it is important to have empathy for children where we can, especially those in the minority. As someone who has seen friends struggle with their gender identities, policies like these only hurt them more. I have seen families be ripped apart and become violent by the news that their children are transgender or non-binary. These violent actions have happened before my eyes in the state of Virginia. Yes, parents do have a right to know about their children's lives, but at what cost? Rights do not outweigh ethics or the safety of children. I no longer want to see the students of Virgina fear that they will be outed to their parents, thrown out of their own homes, and disowned by the ones who are supposed to love and care for them. That will happen if this policy takes effect. Not only is the policy going against evidence-based best practices for LGBTQ+ youth, but it puts the lives of the children in danger either by their own hands or their family members. As a graduate student studying Clinical Mental Health Counseling, I hope that my future clients are not those impacted by this policy, but that they can say that their government was trying to protect them in an already challenging time. I oppose the guidance and find the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools to be a safety concern for non-binary and transgender youth. I urge the VDOE to reject the draft policy. Thank you for your time.",134997,9/26/22  3:31pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=134997

"Anonymous, school district ",Transgender policy,"I support this fully. In their haste to protect a very small number of children with gender dysphoria, Virginia democrats made schools unsafe for girls. Their policies created a hostile learning environment that forced many children, including mine, out of public schools, and promoted a lifestyle with a high suicide rate to impressionable children  who likely wouldn’t have experienced gender dysphoria, inadvertently or intentionally encouraging them to adopt it. What they did was abhorrent, and protecting young girls and the minds of children is always the right the thing to do. Thank you for your courage.

Oliver Coley ,I fully oppose this policy ,"This policy goes completely against evidence-based best practices for ensuring the safety of transgender kids. Whether you like it or not, transgender children exist and they deserve the right to safety just as much as any other child. As children we spend a considerable amount of time in school, and if school is not a safe space that takes a serious toll on the mental and physical health of the child. Being allowed to use their preferred name and pronouns, and being permitted to dress in a way that matches their gender identity makes a huge difference to the mental well being of a transgender child, and this has been proven time and time again by every legitimate evidence-based health organization. For many transgender students, school is the one place they can feel safe and supported and requiring parental approval for pronouns usage and restricting students to sex-based (rather than gender based) dress codes will result in a significant detrimental affect on their mental health. Additionally, requiring school staff to share information with parents about the student's gender identity is dangerous and could expose that child to abuse.  I myself am transgender, and back when I was in middle and high school I was allowed to wear the boys uniform despite it not matching my legal sex. Being permitted to wear the boys uniform allowed me to feel comfortable at school and made it so that I could focus on learning. If I had been forced to wear the girls uniform I would have dreaded going to school every day and would not have been able to focus in class because every day would feel like I was living a nightmare. If I had not been supported by the people in my life both at school and at home I would not be alive today. I am lucky that my parents are accepting because for many children that is not the case, and taking away the ability for school to be a safe place will make it so that many of those children do not live to become adults. I do not think that parental rights should supersede the child's right to safety, and this policy is actively putting transgender children at risk. This is not just an opinion; best practices for transgender students are backed by research and evidence and blatantly disregarding those best practices is to intentionally and knowingly endanger those students. It is our duty to make schools a safe space for all kids, and this policy will do the opposite.",135030,9/26/22  3:32pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135030

However, the very real damage it will do to the children that just want to live their lives without daily bullying is against Virginia statute and it puts their lives at real risk. 82% of trans kids contemplate suicide and 40% have already attempted suicide. You should be ashamed of yourselves for politicizing this at the expense of children’s lives.

Joyce R. ,"I fully oppose, for the safety of all children.","Trans children are a threat to no one. They will not hurt you, your children, or themselves simply by virtue of being transgender. No one around them will become transgender by osmosis. It isn’t a disease or a threat, it’s simply a way of existing. It is the school’s responsibility to keep all children safe from the moment they get on the bus in the morning until the moment they step off in the afternoon and the proposed policy is antithetical to that. If school cannot be a place of refuge for trans children who want to be who they know they are because it’s not in line with how their parents want to raise them, perhaps the school should also refrain from alerting the appropriate authorities when there is evidence of abuse or neglect at home. Should children of parents who want them to diet be refused  lunch? Should children of parents who dream for all-star athletes be barred from arts classes? After all, the parents know what’s best. This is a spineless policy change, presented not with a single child’s best interest in mind, but built on the back of fear mongering, cruelty, and state sanctioned violence against a deeply marginalized group. I implore you to reject this policy wholly. It does not protect children, it does not give the parents rights they are supposedly owed — it tightens an oppressive grip that will endanger the mental and physical health of children across the state.",135062,9/26/22  3:34pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135062

This will only lead to more suicides and attacks on already marginalized people. This targeted hate towards trans kids only further divides this country. There is no reason on Earth to target these kids unless you are trying to create fear for political gain. School is hard enough for most kids. Why make it even harder? School is a place to educate and learn in a safe and, ideally, a nurturing and fun environment. As a Christian woman I am appalled by the hate and fear created by the conservatives in this country. Jesus would have been murdered as a tree-hugging libtard according to the way conservatives act these days. My family has been in Virginia for over 200 years. I saw promise in recent years that the state and people would grow and move beyond it's fearful, redneck spite and hate.

Jack Shelton ,I support ,"Guidance Document Change: Every day, throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia, educators and school leaders work to ensure that all students have an opportunity to receive a high-quality education. As a part of that work, educators strive to meet the individual needs of all students entrusted to their care, and teachers work to create educational environments where all students thrive. The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students. The Department also fully acknowledges the rights of parents to exercise their fundamental rights granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children. The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents to determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is essential to improving outcomes for all children in Virginia. The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological belief. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or religious beliefs. The Department embarked on a thorough review of the Model Policies Guidance adopted on March 4, 2021 (the “2021 Model Policies”). The 2021 Model Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools. The 2021 Model Policies also disregarded the rights of parents and ignored other legal and constitutional principles that significantly impact how schools educate students, including transgender students. With the publication of these 2022 Model Policies (the “2022 Model Policies”), the Department hereby withdraws the 2021 Model Policies, which shall have no further force and effect. The Department issues the 2022 Model Policies to provide clear, accurate, and useful guidance to Virginia school boards that align with statutory provisions governing the Model Policies. See Code of Virginia, § 22.1-23.3 (the “Act”). Significantly, the 2022 Model Policies also consider over 9,000 comments submitted to the Department during the public comment period for the 2021 Model Policies.",135120,9/26/22  3:36pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135120

Marjorie Carlson ,"I am the parent of a trans kid, and this policy is deadly","I am both the parent of a transgender child, and a social worker who has studied trans mental health for years (well before the issue was as politicized and polarized as it is today). So I feel the need to weigh in on this extremely dangerous policy. Transgender children are at significantly elevated risk of a wide range of negative life outcomes: parental abuse, youth homelessness (after being kicked out by parents), depression, suicidality, drug dependence, etc. Importantly, however, decades of research suggest that NONE of these negative outcomes are intrinsic to being transgender. Instead, they are ALL a result of living as a trans person in a society that abuses and stigmatizes being trans. Society's poor reactions to trans people leads to terrible outcomes -- not being trans itself. The role of school has been particularly studied. What researchers have found is that social transitioning at school massively reduces the risk of adverse outcomes, while being harassed in school for being trans increases those risks. See for example Turban et al, ""Timing of Social Transition for Transgender and Gender Diverse Youth, K-12 Harassment, and Adult Mental Health Outcomes."" Affirming trans kids' identity at school demonstrably reduces suicides, which means I am not exaggerating when I say that gender-affirming policies literally save lives. So, contrary to what the new proposed document claims, Virginia's existing, 2021 model policy wasn't written to 'promote a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools.' It was written because decades of research tell us that affirming policies save kids' lives. This is ESPECIALLY important in cases where the transgender child lives with abusive and/or transphobic parents. In these cases, when a child comes out to a safe teacher or counselor, should the teacher or counselor inform the parents? Doing so serves no purpose except to put that child at increased risk of abuse and homelessness. Again, this is well researched. When parents are, tragically, a literal threat to students' safety and mental health, we have to weigh the good of parental authority against the good of keeping children safe. This guidance document is asking you to choose parental authority over kids' safety. That is a terrible course of action, and I implore you to reject it.",135135,9/26/22  3:37pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135135

Finnegan Hinson ,Transgender Children Deserve Education Without Disruption ,Policies like this one are designed to aliente and scare transgender youth into having less support in the classroom. For some trans kids that's the only safe place. Forcibly outing children subjects them to potential abuse at home. I believe this harms the lives of children and makes me nervous about putting any child in Virginia public schools if a policy like this is deemed acceptable.,135133,9/26/22  3:37pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135133
Joe ,Fully Opposed to this BIll. Trans Rights are Human Rights,"Beyond the fact that these guidelines seem to entirely abridge a student's right to privacy, they forcibly degrade them by not allowing them any exploration of their identity outside of home. To force a child to live with something that may just cause them further duress out of fear of a bad reaction at home is needlessly cruel and wrong. To degrade a simple statement as ""not everyone experiences an extremely complex facet of human identity such as gender the same way"" as a political ideal is simply incorrect and factually untrue, as it has been noted throughout all of history that gender non-conformity is universal throught humankinds existence. And to come back to the note regarding student's privacy, while parents do have a right to know what their kids are learning or what their child tells their teacher, this does not entitle them to encroach on their childs privacy. As noted by the ACLU, a student's right to privacy is implied in the Constitution and, while some rights do become muddy upon entering school, ones regarding privacy do not. I cannot think of a set of guidelines that are more needlessly cruel and dehumanizing than these guidelines and simply ignore the right of privacy that students are entitled to. 40% of trans youth have attempted suicide, the last thing they need is another law that simply views their difficulties in life as delusions.",135136,9/26/22  3:37pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135136

Atlas ,I strongly oppose this as a trans student myself.,"I began questioning mu sexuality about six years ago in the sixth grade. I wondered why holding a girls hand made me get butterflies. I had thought once about how I like boys the way boys like boys. It didn't click in my mind until seventh grade. Stress, depression, anxiety, stuff that comes from puberty, and all sorts of junk just came flooding into my life and I will admit, I was confused. But I wasn't mindlessly confused or uneducated about it, I was confused because I didn't know how I would manage these feelings and how I would express them socially. I had identified under several names online and the gender ambiguity gave me some sort of happiness. This seeped into my life and I began to identify as different identities. I used different names and I'm glad that I was with a group who not only supported me, but helped me as well. But that was only with friends. And it was a small group. Every time something about sexuality or gender came up in class, I'd be nervous. I'd hope my peers wouldn't be disgusted or offended or anything of the sort. This kind of fear continued on. I rarely spoke to my school about my preferred pronouns or name because I was too scared to say anything. I don't think students should feel that way as they develop into adults. Shouldn't we have trusted adults in our life who can help us? It was only then, by sophomore years, that I talked to a counselor about possibly changing my preferred name and what gender was in my transcript. When that happened I felt happy. I was able to introduce myself in the way I wanted. Albeit, it wasn't the name I wanted to go by, but it was rather an androgynous nickname that I didn't mind. It had to take me more than a couple of years to reach to the point where I am now. Six years of questioning, being frightened about what others may think, and only feeling support from a few friends and the internet. It's pitiful that I couldn't talk to someone about it, that I couldn't tell my parents about how i felt until I was in 9th grade  or teachers until 10th grade. I still struggle to feel accepted sometimes. I'm afraid that my peers will question me, be uninformed, or simply be ignorant about it. It benefits many people, students, staff, and families, to be educated on what's going on. Parents may choose the way a child is raised and educated, but they aren't able to control how their child grows and develops. Parents who think they can, will only end up hurting not only their child, but themselves and their family. Educate people on how people are. You can opt out of as many classes as you want, take your child out of school, and kept them hidden in your house. But once they are out of their parents hands, their behavior and actions will not only reflect on the person, but their parents as well. Know well and learn well. And please, keep children safe and out of harms way; physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Your child isn't you and you aren't your child. They are a separate being from you . So please, if you want what's best for your child, think critically about yourself too.",135143,9/26/22  3:37pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135143

Susan Fitch ,Youngkin's discriminatory VDOE policies,"Governor Youngkin's proposed policies are contrary to state law and will be extremely harmful to LGBTQ+ children, opening them up to the risk of abuse and possible homelessness. In addition, LGBTQ+ kids already suffer higher rates of depression and are at greater risk of suicide. Data published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has showed that about 2 percent of high school students identify as transgender, and 35 percent of those have attempted suicide. These policies will endanger the health and well-being of these children.    These policies will also make it hard to attract businesses with large numbers of jobs to Virginia, as large companies will not be interested in opening offices in states with discriminatory policies. In sum, I do not support implementation of Governor Youngkin's proposed policies, and urge VDOE to reject them in their entirety.",135151,9/26/22  3:37pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135151
A VA Teacher ,I OPPOSE: This proposal will lead to the violation of human rights.,"In the debate regarding parents' rights, we often forget those whose rights are being left behind - the rights of the children themselves. It is the job of educators to help children become individualized and productive, and to help give them the tools to face the world. In school, children need to feel that they can express themselves and be who they are in order to learn how to contribute to our larger society. To rob children of this choice will lead to further psychological stress, and, ultimately, higher suicide rates for transgender citizens of Virginia. In our rush to ""give rights back to parents,"" let's not forget who we would ultimately be stealing rights from - their kids. Even if this proposal were to take effect, as a teacher in a VA public school, I will personally refuse to use a name or pronoun that a student has told me they do not identify with. I will quit or be fired before doing so, as would many of my talented and experienced coworkers. This would in direct contrast with Youngkin's proposed promise to end the teacher shortage in Virginia. Also, an editing note - under Section II bullet number 2, on page four of this proposal, it states, ""Parents are in the best position to work with their children and...determine what names, nicknames, and/or pronouns, if any..."" The grammatical issue I have with this statement is this: everyone uses pronouns. Every single person has pronouns. Identifying as a person that does not feel the need to tell others their pronouns doesn't mean you do not have them; it likely means you're just transphobic. Do not rescind the 2021 policy.",135154,9/26/22  3:37pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135154

Anonymous ,In favor of supporting parents’ rights in the decisions of minor children,"Although I understand where those opposed to this policy are coming from, I am in favor of the proposed policy for several reasons. As a parent of two students in FCPS, I would want to know if either of my children were considering changing their pronouns or considered transitioning their gender. I don’t believe this is the type of thing that should be hidden from me as a parent. It’s not the school’s responsibility to affirm or deny this type of conduct. I should be able to know and have appropriate discussions with my child privately and with their pediatrician to see what our options are. I could see one of my children not wanting to tell us out of embarrassment or anxiety at our potential reaction, no matter how much we tell them now that we will love them no matter who they are. Children hear from the media, news and now possibly from those at school that they need to hide from their parents their reality or struggles out of fear from how parents will react. I think those opposed to this proposal are greatly overestimating that parents will have a negative reaction, quite possibly because they are imagining how their own parents would have reacted 30-40 years ago. But people and culture have changed much in that amount of time, and I believe that parents in general are much more accommodating than they were back then. Thus, I believe the reasons for hiding such matters from parents are greatly overstated. I also believe that schools shouldn’t be hiding such information from parents because that’s not their role. Schools should be informing parents of anything positive or negative that is occurring at school. They are caretakers while kids are at school but they are not the ultimate decision makers, and these decisions should be made with parental input, not by minors unilaterally. These are children who cannot do many things because of their age and lack of experience, and we should not encourage them to make life altering decisions on their own if they are under 18, nor should we default to the decisions of those without the life experience to make these types of decisions. I am for the proposal for all these reasons. ",135162,9/26/22  3:38pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135162

Jill Plack ,Anti-LGBTQ+ policies teen raise suicide rate,"Anti-LGBTQ+ policies raise suicide for teens. These kids are already targets for bullies and often shunned and abandoned by their own parents. But they don’t deserve that. They are fully human and citizens you swore to serve. What if it was your child? Maybe you wouldn’t want them to be gay or trans, but would you want them suicidal? This isn’t just my opinion. Below is some data for you to consider.

The results give more context to the potential effects of social policy on mental health. The researchers found that suicide attempts by high school students decreased by 7 percent in states after they passed laws to legalize same-sex marriage, before the Supreme Court legalized it nationwide in 2015. Among LGB high school students, the decrease was especially concentrated, with suicide attempts falling by 14 percent. But in states that did not legalize same-sex marriage, there was no change.” https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/same-sex-marriage-fewer-youth-suicide I would add that the goal of these policies seems to be to destabilize Virginia for political gain.

Drew Rivas ,Strongly Oppose - This will endanger students.,"This change to the guidelines is not a protection of parents Fourteenth Amendment rights; rather, it is a violation of those rights for transgender students across the state. Furthermore, the claim that our previous model ""promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools"" is entirely biased - the viewpoint represented through these changes is promoting an even more specific viewpoint of hate towards transgender adolescents, albeit under the guise of promoting ""parental rights."" As demonstrated by both the document itself and many of the comments here written in support of it, the withdrawing of 2021 Model Policies regarding transgender students is designed to harm said students. The former Model Policies were not pushing any political beliefs on students, only protecting those who identified in opposition to their birth gender. With these protections revoked, transgender students will not just be as vulnerable as they were before, but more so than ever - as the policy of informing parents of students' desires regarding their gender identity will endanger them en masse. When a child does not feel safe telling a parent about their transgender identity on their own accord, there is a reason for it. By making these changes to the Model Policies, we will be ensuring that transgender adolescents in Virginia schools will lose what may be their only form of safe space. Rates of abuse and suicide in these students will skyrocket. Anyone in support of this bill is in support of harm coming to these children and teenagers, who all have a right to live and learn in safety just as much as any of their cisgender peers do. These outing policies aren't ""more compliant"" with Constitutional rights, even for parents. Schools were never making any medical or ethical decisions by allowing students to express themselves without worry. Simply put, these 2022 Model Policy changes are draconian, and will endanger our transgender youth. There is no world in which this isn't true.

Anonymous ,Couldn’t oppose this any more strongly.,"Couldn’t oppose this any more strongly. Let transgender children and, yes, even questioning children who’ll ultimately decide they’re not trans exist and figure themselves out without adults, including authority figures, bullying them - anyone who doesn’t see that that’s what anti-trans policies aimed at children are should not be making rules concerning children. You can’t make trans people stop existing by banning recognition and validation of them - only breed very deserved resentment. P.S. It’s very, very creepy to base your treatment of anyone, especially a child, on what you think their genitals looked like when they were born instead of their personality and how they interact with the world. Everything about transphobia is creepy at the baseline and arbitrarily, willfully-ignorantly reductive of how complicated humans and the way we interact with and see each other and ourselves are at best. And the correct response to seeing something that seems too complicated for you to grasp isn’t to deny that it’s real or meretricious - that’s irresponsible. It’s to either learn or to accept that it’s not personally your area and leave it to people who get it.",135321,9/26/22  3:44pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135321

Kaitlin Johnston ,Proposed Policies Prevent Student Achievement ,"If the goal of the VDOE is to educate all children in Virginia, then the proposed Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia work against that goal.  As a Virginia high school teacher and sponsor of my school's GSA club, I see and hear firsthand the harassment, bullying, and lack of access to services my LGBTQIA+ students experience.   I myself have been intimidated and threatened for being the sponsor of this club. Feeling comfortable (able to use the restroom, change in the locker room, etc.), feeling respected (being called by the correct name and pronouns), and feeling included (not treated as an other because of their identity) are prerequisites to being able to learn.  Without safety, respect, and inclusion, students cannot learn.  LGBTQIA+ students have the right to an education, just like every other student in Virginia.  These proposed policies prevent LGBTQIA+ students from being able to access their education in the same way all other students do.  These policies are also illegal.  The Virginia Human Rights Act, signed into law March 2021, protects ""all individuals within the Commonwealth from unlawful discrimination because of ... sexual orientation, gender identity ... in places of public accommodation, including educational institutions "" (emphasis added).  It is discriminatory to prevent these students from being called by their preferred names, pronouns, or access the facilities they need to take care of their personal health needs. Not only do these illegal policies prevent students from learning, they are also morally and ethically wrong.  LGBTQIA+ students have every right to assert their identity at every age, and to assert that identity within school.  Just because other people don't like or are uncomfortable with how they identify doesn't mean such students must hide or run away.  Schools are places to where everyone, no matter their class, race, disability status, or gender identity, come together with a common goal: to learn.  LGBTQIA+ people have been part of humanity since time immemorial.  You cannot legislate them or policy them away.  They are part of our community, part of our schools, and part of our Commonwealth.  LGBTQIA+ students deserve dignity, respect, and the right to learn like all other students.",135340,9/26/22  3:45pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135340

Anonymous ,I fully OPPOSE this guidance,"I am a mother of three children currently enrolled in Virginia schools, one of which identifies as non-binary/gender fluid. Although my children are provided a safe environment at home where their identity is welcomed and accepted, not all homes provide this nurturing environment. Children learn best when they feel safe and included- when they are seen and heard. Educators are expected to play a primary role in Preventing and Responding to Child Abuse and Neglect. They are also expected to provide a safe environment in preventing and stopping bullying which involves a commitment to creating a safe environment where all children can thrive, socially and academically, without being afraid. Weighing all of the data you will see strong support in the benefits of incorporating diversity, equity, and inclusion in the public school environment to ensure all Virginian's, including all LGBTQ+ Virginian youth, are free to learn in the most equitable and inclusive manner possible.  ",135373,9/26/22  3:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135373

Youngkin will kill children and that is a fact.  Schools are often a refuge for students; they need to feel welcomed, safe; they need to have a sense of belonging.  This policy will completely take that away from our students.  We need to allow students to bring their authentic selves to school and not have to fear that school staff and students won't accept them for who they are.  LGBTQIA+ students commit suicide for just these reasons and Gov Youngkin will have their blood on his hands if this model policy moves forward.  We need to protect ALL students not just the ones Youngkin likes.  ",135380,9/26/22  3:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135380

Markus ,I Oppose This,"It is telling that this administration ran on giving ""freedom to parents"" in terms of their children's education, but then decides to make unpopular decisions on their behalf. What this is really about is pandering towards the extreme rightwing portion of this country (not us native Virginians) by harming transgender children and increasing Governor Youngkin's national profile for his increasingly rumored presidential run in 2024. I maintain that this policy helps no one: neither kids nor parents, and it certainly holds no statistical evidence in improving Virginia's education status, which I was under the impression this government was intending to do. Virginia has always been resilient to political extremes.

E. R. T. ,I am OPPOSED ,"I am absolutely opposed to these changes. Trans students just want a safe and respectful environment to learn, which is a right of ALL students in Virginia. All kids (and adults!), whether they are transgender or cisgender, want their correct name and pronouns to be used, and they want to use the facilities that are appropriate and comfortable for them. Imagine how hard it would be to learn if teachers couldn't refer to you by your correct name, if you were constantly being called by the wrong pronouns, and being forced to use the wrong bathroom. It would be difficult to learn. It would be stressful and distressing. It would probably even make you feel unsafe. No child in Virginia should be subjected to that. These new guidelines ONLY serve to make trans kids' lives harder, and that's not what this state stands for. Politicians here need to stop making trans kids targets to try to win political points.

First, school is a place of diversity in backgrounds and experience. It should be an inclusive and welcoming place for all. This proposal seeks to ""other"" a group of students as Virginia has historically done with people of color, gay people, and people who do not speak English as a first language.  The proposal does this under the color of ""parent's rights"" --just as years ago some parents closed public schools rather than desegregate them. This is wrong. Second, I do not want school districts to imperil my tax dollars for costly litigation and settlements for violating people's rights.  Just last year Gloucester settled their lawsuit for 1.3 million. Finally, as a parent I want my child to be included and embraced in school --trans, gay, or otherwise.

Caroline Garcia ,This policy will lead to violence.,"Recently, the Governor of Virginia released a new proposal for school systems across the commonwealth, regarding transgender and queer youth. Glenn Youngkin’s new policy will put targets on the back of trans students, and create a path of violence and hostility for all openly LGBTQ+ people.  The new school policies would require students to go to the bathroom, not aligned with their gender, putting them in the face of uncomfortable and dangerous situations. Teachers and school administrators will be required to release the gender identity, sexual orientation, prefered name and gender to parents, gardians, and peers. This will put trans and LGBTQ+ students in danger at home, especially if parents or guardians are not  accepting.  The school also cannot use the prefered pronouns or names of transgender students, and in some cases, even if the trans student has a court signed document of a legal name change. This will make it hard for trans students to have access to an equal education for simply being transgender. All of these new proposed policies are in the name of “Parents Rights,” while simuntasosly showing students they do not have full access to their mind or body without state control. This creates a scary future for all students, teachers, community members, trans people, and virginians. We will see the rise of sucicde rates, the rise of sex work amoung young queer people, the rise of homelessness, and the decline of acceptence. This is the future the Governor wants, this is the future the republicans want, this is the future we will inherit if we do not stand up today. With all of that being said, I want to show my support for LGBTQ students across this commonwealth and let them know Virginia is for all!!",135418,9/26/22  3:48pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135418

What kind of parent would I be for sending my non-binary child to a school that actively seeks to deny their identity? Why would I put my child in harm's way by sending them to school that is unsupportive and hostile, forcing them to hide their identity when their focus should be on learning and positively contributing to the school community?   The medical research is very clear - trans, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ youth are at a higher risk of suicide and mental health diagnoses than the general population, and the number one protective factor is a supportive adult in their lives. Per Suicidality Among Transgender Youth: Elucidating the Role of Interpersonal Risk Factors, ""school belonging, emotional neglect by family, and internalized self-stigma made a unique, statistically significant contribution to past 6-month suicidality.""  Public schools exist, by definition, for the public, and the public includes children of every race, sex, language spoken, gender expression, religion, and sexual orientation. All children in public schools should feel like they belong, no matter their identity, and it's hard to fathom that this is even up for debate in 2022.   Ultimately, exclusionary policies like this result in military families like mine refusing to live in states like Virginia.   ",,9/26/22  3:49pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135431

Mark Spooner ,How many of the opponents of the Model Policy have actually read it?,"The Model Policy mandates nondiscrimination, non-bullying and compassion.  Its ""controversial"" provisions are: (1) It says that school boards can't keep secrets from parents or override parental decisions on how to deal with a child's gender identity issues.  (2) It says that transgender kids must compete on the athletic teams of their biological gender.  (3) It says that students should use the bathrooms and locker rooms of their biological gender if alternative accommodations (e.g., single use facilities) aren't available.  For a more complete analysis please go to FairfaxSchoolsMonitor.com, where I have recently posted several articles on this subject, including a comparison of the Model Policy to the far-left regulation in effect in Fairfax County. The majority of the comments posted before mine oppose the policy, but I wonder how many of the commenters have actually studied it.  From my experience in monitoring what's going on in one populous Virginia county, I know that the LGBT community, teachers' unions and other liberal and leftist groups are much more active than middle-of-the-road parents.  They have the ability to mobilize mass responses to surveys like this; much more so than busy parents do.  But don't be fooled by just counting up the comments.  How many of the opposing comments have real substance to them that makes sense? I have read many of the opposing comments.  I have yet to see one that rationally explains why schools should be permitted to provide ""gender affirming care"" to students without telling the parents what they are doing.  This violates Virginia law, which says that ""a parent has a fundamental right to make decisions concerning the upbringing, education, and care of the parent's child.""  Va. Code sec. 1-240.1.  It also sounds like candidate McAuliffe, who tried to convince voters last year that parents shouldn't be telling teachers what to teach.  Nor have I seen a rational explanation of why biological males should be permitted to override the privacy rights and safety interests of girls by competing on girls' athletic teams and by using girls' locker rooms.  These are the key issues addressed by the Model Policy.             These are common-sense measures that the vast majority undoubtedly agrees with",135451,9/26/22  3:50pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135451

Julie Gunlock ,Thank you Gov. Youngkin!,"Adults should never encourage kids to keep secrets from their parents. Yet, that's exactly the system the VA Department of Education created in 2021 when Governor Ralph Northam's ""model policies"" allowed school officials to hide a child's new gender identity from parents. Governor Glenn Youngkin recognizes parents rights and has made clear that parents' beliefs should be recognized and respected. The 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools is a critical step in keeping parents informed about their children's health and wellbeing. Virginia school districts, including those who have already communicated their plans to ignore the 2022 revised model policies, should put an end to secret Gender Support Plans now. These same school districts claim that disclosing this information to parents would harm trans-identifying students. Yet, the Code of Virginia already requires teachers or other school employees, when acting in their professional role, to immediately report suspected child abuse or neglect that may have happened outside the school setting. Governor Youngkin's new model policies don't change existing VA law. If a child is abused or neglected, a teacher or school official must still report that to state authorities.  Virginia's government run schools must respect the role of parents in a child's life. As the mother of three children, I'm grateful that Governor Youngkin seeks to strengthen the child-parent bond and I support the 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for all Students and Parents in Virginia’s Public Schools.",,9/26/22  3:50pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135453

Evan Murray ,This policy is bad for students and teachers.,"While we all wish that parents were unconditionally loving, many of us know better. Too many LGBTQ youth are at high risk of abuse or even rejection (and homelessness) if their families find out. That's why they don't share their identities, especially while they're still figuring them out. Kids from families that are safe will tell their parents when they're ready, probably early in the process. My children confided in me early.Kids from families that aren't will be in danger if school staff inform their parents. I didn't tell mine until I was an independent adult. Teachers see kids more than almost anyone else in their lives and know them well. They're mandated reporters, so if they suspect abuse, they report it. But they also definitely know kids that are from families that aren't legally abusive, but that aren't supportive. They know when a child will be punished for something as simple as a nickname or as profound as being trans. A policy forcing disclosure will force teachers to override their own judgement of what's best for the child. It will place children in danger. Trust your teachers and school staff to center the best interests of children and young people. Trust young people to know when it's safe for them to tell their parents who they are. And trust that a child asking to be called a different name, or referred to as a girl or boy or neither or both, is just going through a normal part of human development. ",135462,9/26/22  3:50pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135462

JD ,A sad policy that does not help students,"This proposed model policy is detrimental to the student experience in Virginia Public Schools. While veiled as a push to overturn a model policy that ""disregarded the rights of parents,"" this new policy instead hinders the self-expression and development of trans students. Parents, of course, have a right to be involved in their child's education. But as students develop and differentiate from their parents, it's important that the school staff--teachers, counselors, administrators--be allowed to offer support and guidance. This proposed policy targets a small and especially at-risk subgroup of students for unnecessary scrutiny and antagonism. It makes no room for students from unsupportive or abusive households to find shelter in their school community, nor does it protect students in any meaningful way. It is a dangerous policy that treats students as mere vessels of their parent's wishes, and it demeans well-adjusted parents who do not need minute control of their child's life. This vision of ""parenting"" is involved to a fault, and leaves little room for students to grow. Does the administration trust students so little? Bad education, health, and family policy.

Anonymous ,Inhumane Treatment of Transgender Children,"Passage of bans in our schools that directly attack our children are an inherent threat to the community. There is no reason there should be any kind of policy affecting a child's ability to express who they are openly and publicly. Nor should there be a policy that would endanger a child's safety because they are LGBTQ+. The damage this would cause to transgender kids lives would be traumatic and irreversible. These kind of policy changes are what would force a child to share a part of them they may not feel comfortable sharing yet and as a result could lead to that child being bullied, mistreated, or even assaulted. There are still families in this state who would sooner kick their child out of their home for being gay or trans than accept them. This would only contribute to the issue of homeless youth in this state. It is clear that an attack on transgender youth is meant to come as the first wave towards attacking the rights of LGBTQ+ Virginians. I have news for you, Governor Youngkin: These bans - these policies - will NOT stop kids from being trans. They will, however, contribute to the suicide statistics affecting both young people and transgender individuals.  It is evident that this has either been thought through with clear calculation and hatred towards a group of individuals who only want to be loved and respected; OR these things have not been considered, meaning Virginia has elected an official who lacks mindfulness for his constituents. Either way, this policy is offensive and discriminatory. It does nothing to serve the Commonwealth or its people. There are better things the governor can be doing with his time, like finding a way to increase public funding for education, building our infrastructure, and keeping Virginia beautiful and clean. Transgender people are not a threat.",135549,9/26/22  3:54pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135549

The rate of suicide among transgender children is the highest of any cohort of children. Data indicate that 82% of transgender individuals have considered killing themselves and 40% have attempted suicide, with suicidality highest among transgender youth.  In some (perhaps many) cases, the source of the transgender child's shame and suicidal behavior comes from parents who do not how to raise a trans child.

Lauren Boland ,"This is trans genocide under the guise of ""Parents rights""","I don't expect this to gain any traction in the sea of awful 1-sentence comments, but it needs to be said. I am a trans person in the State of Virginia with children in our school districts.  These policy changes will do nothing but cruelly put children in danger. People telling you that this is better for ""parents rights"" are 100% the kind of parents that would disown their child for being queer. Teachers and schools have been a safe haven for kids trying to figure themselves out for a long time. We need to allow kids to feel like they are safe somewhere other than home... because for many queer kids, it is not safe at home (and all of these comments reinforce that). Anyone saying that any transgender rights involve surgeries of any kind is acting in bad faith.  The very basic parts of the beginning of a transition involve only social things. Letting kids be themselves.  Please talk to other trans people. Get to know the human beings that you are hurting with this sort of rhetoric.  These policies are telling our children that they are not welcome in society, and never will be. The cruelty cannot be understated.  If you are not trans, put yourself in their shoes by imaging what it would be like if the government said that you can't use the bathroom that you normally use... or if the government said that you had to use the opposite pronouns or a name that you don't go by.  The entire point of cruel policies like this is to remove trans people from the public eye, and it is disgusting in this day and age that we still allow people to discriminate against already marginalized people. ",135685,9/26/22  4:00pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135685

Short Pump Resident ,Oppose: This will harm LGBTQ+ youth,"Not that this will change his or anyone's mind, but this policy will do stoke the fires of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric, policies, and behaviors. This line of decision making will empower those that believe that everyone should follow their own belief system, and those who do not conform shall feel the wrath. Trans youth are not targeting, bullying, or grooming your children. They are simply existing and trying to find peace and acceptance in a cruel world. They deserve love, compassion, and support from the education system. School should be a place of protection from any negative thoughts, not somewhere that forces religious beliefs in a supposedly-secular establishment. This will be harmful and the harm will be broader than you expect. Your beloved straight cis child will hurt when they see their transgender friend struggling or, God forbid, give in to terrible thoughts because they never received support. Your own children will empathize and grieve the loss of freedom and acceptance. You say think of the children, OPPOSING this policy IS thinking of the children, their emotions, and friendships.

"Deirdre Middleton, MPH ",I vehemently oppose this. ,"This proposal to misgender children endangers transgender and gender nonconforming kids. Requiring the school systems to discriminate and mistreat children would cause enormous harm to some of the most vulnerable kids in the school system.

Aerin Hafner ,I was a trans teen,I was a trans teen in the 90s. Nobody except me knew. I didn't transition until years later. My school's policies were unsupportive of any queerness. Gay kids were punished for holding hands in the halls and weren't allowed to take their partners to prom. Wearing gender nonconforming clothes was against the rules.

Valerie Montgomery ,Gender issues in school ,"As a retired teacher, I see a disturbing lack of understanding and empathy in the Governor’s new policy restricting the rights of students with gender conflicts. Requiring teachers to “out” these children to parents, and thus the latgerbcommunity, could have tragic consequences. Not all parents will be receptive and loving , which will only exacerbate the stress these young people are enduring. It also prematurely labels a student whose gender identity may be in flux and not truly “settled.” Adolescence is difficult for EVERYONE and these new policies only add to the stress and will undoubtedly lead to harm, such as suicide or guardian/parental /peer abuse in many cases. re: Bathroom issues. Surely some kinder solution can be found to the bathroom use concerns by further discussion and planning. Involve the students, themselves, in the search for solutions. Empathy and love for young people needs to be the underlying foundation for any policy in schools !",135745,9/26/22  4:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135745

"Shirley Carley, GLSEN ",This is dangerous!,"This legislation would put already at risk teenagers and even more danger. Many LBGTQ students do not have parental support. Some are abused. In some cases children will be kicked out of their homes if their parents find out they identify as LGBTQ. Kids are supposed to be able to talk to their counselors to feel safe. They should be able to talk to a trusted adult like a teacher and feel safe. If this legislation passes these kids have no one to protect them. 7% of teenagers in America identify as LGBTQ, yet 40% of homeless teenagers identify as LBGTQ. The reason for this disparity? Children are kicked out of their homes because of who they are or who they love! Please do not allow this to pass. Protect our children! In addition to homelessness, laws such as this one can lead to a child harming themselves or killing themselves! This legislation is dangerous and must not pass!",135757,9/26/22  4:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135757
Susan Gempka ,Governor Youngkin is wrong.,"I am totally against the hurtful conditions you intend to impose on trans children and their families.  You claim to do this in the guise of protecting all students and parents, however, this policy does not protect them.  It can only make people feel hurt and uncomfortable.  You are calling out personal attributes and health issues on one target: Trans children.  Instead, have you tried being kind and helpful?  Have you thought maybe you could keep previous policies in place? And what are you seemingly protecting?  Accepting people for who they are? Making everyone feel comfortable and cared for? I feel that you have chosen this issue as a way to gain attention for yourself.   It is a non-problem and you are letting power go to your head, in my opinion.

"Lynlee Thorne, parent ",Do not force public school staff to threaten the lives of students,"With this guidance, VDOE would assume an active role in facilitating violent harm to trans and non-binary students. Our public schools must be separate and distinct from extremist religious ideology.  A governing body that denies individuals the right to self-determination is an inherently oppressive one. There is no confusion, no room for debate. We have mountains of hard data that inform us that we are able to save lives when we acknowledge and affirm the expressed gender identity of individuals. Violence and suicide increase exponentially when we deny, reject, shame, and require individuals to hide the truth of who they are. Children are NOT the property of their parents. We each belong to ourselves. Children and young adults do not need the permission of their parents to be who they are. We know that abuse is most frequently experienced at home, within families. This guidance is cruel. It will further isolate the most vulnerable and already isolated young people in our public school systems. This guidance will deny access to life-saving support from counselors and other school staff to children who lack any form of support at home. This shredding of our social fabric will threaten and end young lives.  For more than 30 years, we have known that efforts to reject the reality of gender expression have been deadly. This extremist administration either has not bothered to educate itself or has opted to knowingly and intentionally inflict harm on those it should protect. How tragic to allow such a narrow, limited, fear-driven, and small view of what it is to be human to inform our policy and steer us backward. What credibility will be left for an institution tasked with educating young people that choses instead to wage violence against them? Trans and non-binary youth are not to be merely tolerated or accepted. The courage to discover who you are and then speak it out loud should be celebrated. To any trans or non-binary people who may read this, thank you. Thank you for being exactly who you are, for bringing a richer, more honest expression of humanity into view. We know the danger of this guidance is a threat to your lives, please know that there are a whole hell of a lot of us who are grateful for your existence and prepared to fight like hell for it.  The National Suicide Prevention Line can be reached by dialing 988. ",135767,9/26/22  4:04pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135767

Kristine Condie ,Protect Transgender Students!!,"Governor Youngkin is violating the civil rights of Virginians with such action!!  This will lead to additional trauma for our most vulnerable children in schools where they should feel safe and protected.  As a former public school teacher and mom of public school students, I find this political stunt to be beyond reproach and disgusting.   Has the Governor ever attended a funeral of a Trans child who decided that death was better than living with ridicule, abuse, and torment?  I have!!  Perhaps the Governor should spend less time with the Family Foundation and more time with FAMILIES of Trans children.   Under Virginia and Federal  law, it’s ILLEGAL to discriminate against someone based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, disability, those age 55+, gender identity, sexual orientation, or military status.   My rolling back such protections, the Governor is violating the law.    ",135770,9/26/22  4:04pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135770
Erika ,I strongly oppose this harmful discriminatory policy,"I strongly oppose this harmful discriminatory policy. It will be so devastating to trans youth and unfortunately mostly likely result in more suicide attempts if kids don’t feel that there is any place for them in their own school system and whole state. All kids need support as they grow and find their place in the world. Trans kids do exist and discriminating against them won’t make that less true, it’ll just create an environment in which they will feel all the more alone and unsupported.

"Lauren Lawson, Valley Voice PLLC ",Strongly oppose these harmful revisions,"Pause. Try to truly imagine how it would feel to know yourself as a person, yet no one believes or supports you. Your own voice is a stranger, your body a mystery. How would this impact how you went about the everyday business of life, especially while trying to complete education required for a productive future life? Let me be clear that that I, as a cisgender woman, cannot possibly describe or imagine how a transgender person feels and moves through life daily. However, to those considering passing this policy, I would ask you to consider the physical, emotional, and psychological damage these changes would surely bring. The draft speaks of constitutional rights, and how such rights will be reinstated with these revisions. This is simply false. The preamble states that the purpose of the Constitution itself is "" in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity..."" Where is the general welfare, defence, or liberty in these changes? Being trans is not a choice. These individuals are at a higher risk of abuse, neglect, homelessness, and poverty, particularly when not supported by a community. Our schools serve to educate and protect children. Trans rights are human rights; public schools, of all places, should provide safe spaces that protect the rights of every student coming through the doors.",135775,9/26/22  4:04pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135775

Anonymous ,Mental illness ,I am for this and we need to get these children the help they need for the mental illness they have. The need of the many over rule the needs of the few. It’s called democracy. Girls should have the opportunity to compete against other girls in sports not boys. They should feel safe in locker rooms and not have boys in there. Everyone supporting allowing this mental illness to be catered to is doing a disservice to the schools and the children and communities they serve. America is behind third world countries in math and science and our city schools are a joke.

Anonymous ,"Strongly support and encourage these efforts to protect our children, return to normalcy","Virginians must insist on initiatives like these, and they can't come soon enough. We must stop discriminating against the vast majority of all students, parents, families and teachers who think and act and speak normally about others, all for virtue signalling and the leftward march. By normally, I refer to societal and reasonable and natural norms that have served us for eons. To force this change for the ideological and misguided notion that children can change their sex and then enforce their misguided ideas on others is lunacy. It defies logic to think that Jennifer Boysko and Hizzonnah Ralph Noah-Tham (once referred to by his peers as ""Blackface"") went down this path in the first place. They can talk all they want about all the effort and surveying and comment-gathering they did in writing the original policy, but we all know it was driven by and dreamt up by and supported by postmodernist ideologues intent on pushing our Commonwealth to the left by abandoning all sense of family, faith, reason, and the rule of law and natural laws.  The policy being reversed must go. It is good and right and proper for this initiative to be approved and enforced.",135830,9/26/22  4:07pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135830

Old White Guy ,LEAVE THESE KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES ALONE!,I’m 67 years old. I’ve seen a few things over that time. These kids and their families have enough to deal with. You really want to add to their stress level? What does it actually accomplish? How does this make our schools function better when teachers and administrators now have to deal with this new made up bogus issue. Republicans always claim to be the party of freedom and personal choice. Yeah… When in actuality all you want to do is control people and form people into what you seem to think is some kind of “Christian“ ideal. People and real life is messy. And complicated. This is an issue that should be dealt with by the children and their families and their doctors and anyone else they choose but should not be done by the state.

School is supposed to be a place that all children feel safe and can learn and instead, this policy would place transgender children at an even greater risk of harm and undoubtedly lead to even higher suicide rates.

Anonymous ,"Inhumane, to say the least","There's no two ways around it: this policy will kill children. Trans kids are like any other human being - they just want to be accepted as they are and have normal lives. Trans kids and teens also have a higher rate of suicidality than any of their peers - based on the most recent NIH data, 82% will experience suicidal ideation and 40% will make an attempt. By sacrificing their privacy and their safety to score points with the base and keep pace with the immeasurable cruelty of Abbott and DeSantis, Youngkin seems perfectly content to add to that 40%. If these so-called ""Christians"" truly believe that we are all fearfully and wonderfully made, why would they believe a trans kid deserves to be treated as less of a person than someone who is cisgender? Why would they put kids who aren't open about their identities with their family yet for whatever reason - and that reason is very often personal safety - at risk of homelessness, violence, and death by having teachers out them to parents who may not be supportive? It really looks like the administration doesn't feel that these kids are deserving of basic human decency and don't care if they die.  You talk a big game about parental rights, but it seems like you only care about parents who think like you and to hell with anyone else. Not one of the three people in the executive branch won by more than 2%, and they would do well do remember that. Perhaps Virginia was not as blue as many of us thought, but we are nowhere near as regressive, soulless, and cruel red as you'd have us be. Trans children aren't hurting anyone, nor are the educators who support them and give them a safe place to grow and be kids. This policy will hurt all of them, and all of us by extension.

Public education is public. Not religious, not political. Parents who dislike the 2021 document do not have the right to dictate to others’ children.

Vicki Currie ,I am opposed to the policy for the treatment of transgender students in VA schools by Youngkin,"I have a family member enrolled in Loudoun County public schools who identifies differently than the gender that was assigned to them at birth. I believe that this individual and all individuals have the right to identify as they choose, as this country provides equal protection to all persons under the law. The Virginia Values Act bans discrimination against LGBTQ people in places of public accommodation, which includes educational institutions like public schools. This means that schools must offer a safe and equal learning environment to all students, teachers, and staff, including those who are LGBTQ. The 2021 policies allow trans and non-binary youth to be safe from bullying, harassment, and discrimination at the hands of their peers, teachers, school staff, and administrators. It also guarantees that supports are in place to allow all youth, including trans and non-binary youth to have access to an equal educational experience. This includes the protection of student privacy and the confidentiality of sensitive information for the student. Therefore, proposed legislation that would require schools to tell a student's parent or guardian if they request to use a different name/pronoun or if they identify as LGBTQ at school would discriminate against the student.  Polling shows that 85% of transgender and non-binary youth, and two-thirds of all LGBTQ youth, say that recent debates around anti-trans bills have negatively impacted their mental health. A 2021 peer-reviewed study by the Trevor Project's researchers found that transgender and non-binary youth who reported gender identity acceptance from teachers and peers had significantly lower odds of attempting suicide in the past year. I oppose the policy proposed by governor Youngkin to remove protection for trans and non-binary students in Virginia schools.",135952,9/26/22  4:12pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135952

Deborah Wyld ,I oppose Governor's proposed transgender student policy,"Gov. Youngkin's proposal for new statewide policies for treatment of transgender students is damaging to already-vulnerable children and a shameful attempt to use these children as pawns in his political ambitions.  What is the big deal with honoring children's wishes to be addressed by a particular name/pronoun?  Who is harmed by doing this?  Why would you turn a classroom -- supposedly a safe place in which children can live and learn --into a hostile environment simply so someone can treat a child with less than respect?  In my day, people thought it was funny to deliberately mispronounce ethnic names, but I can assure you it wasn't funny to those of us with Eastern European-rooted names...it was just another form of bullying.  This is no different.  PROTECT ALL STUDENTS. And how is it helpful to require schools to notify parents before providing counseling services to vulnerable students?  If a teacher (who, by law, is compelled to do so) notifies CPS because a child has confided in him/her about an abusive situation, would you require the school to first inform a parent?  Of course not, because it may be the parent himself/herself who is the abuser or antagonistic element.  This is no different.  PROTECT ALL STUDENTS. Bathroom use according to gender assigned at birth?  Way to ensure bullying (or beating) of an already vulnerable child who just wants to exist (and probably under the radar screen)!  For many transgender students, their birth gender isn't even known by other students (and plenty of kids don't really care).  Times have changed, and plenty of students today are far more tolerant and accepting of others than their parents might be (and I'm betting it's the parents who are inflaming the issue, not the students).  And where and how, exactly, are these ""single non-gender bathrooms"" going to appear (and where's the money to come from to accomplish this?).  According to Pew Research, about 5% of young adults in the US consider themselves transgender or nonbinary, but to hear conservatives talk about it, you'd think our schools are being over-run with thousands of dress-wearing boys who just want to sneak into the girls' bathroom.  In fact, the arguments opposing the accommodation of transgender students is pretty much the same as those once used against mainstreaming disabled students and integrating African-American students into white schools.  Fear, especially fear drummed up by false claims, leads to the tremendous potential for mistreating students and people in general.  Virginia needs to enshrine tolerance and acceptance -- not fear and hatred -- in laws that guide how we interact with each other. I'm considerably older than Gov. Youngkin and I get it.  What's his problem?    ",135996,9/26/22  4:14pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=135996

CS Boylan ,"I oppose the 2022 Model Policies, and so do many if not most Virginians. ","I am writing to communicate in the strongest terms possible that I am against the newly proposed model policies targeting transgender and non-binary students. The experience of gender dysmorphia is real and traumatic for many transgender and non-binary teens. Even just socially transitioning (e.g., name, clothes) alleviated a great deal of my own transgender son's dysmorphia, enough that this mental health stabilized. I feel strongly that other transgender and non-binary students have the life-saving right to be who they are during school hours. The effect of these policies is not to give parents more say - it will in effect give other parents more say over my child. Sex and gender is biology, and has proved to be far more complicated than what I would guess Youngkin and others know. It is as much a medical issue as any other systemic health concern, such as an autoimmune disorder that affects multiple systems.  In summary, I am opposed to the new model policies for many reasons and I advocate for them to be pulled. Keep your beliefs off my child. ",136033,9/26/22  4:15pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136033

Merle Damico ,Strongly Oppose this Proposal,"To whom it may concern, While I am no longer a current public school student, I grew up in Chesterfield County at the time presenting as a woman. I have experienced education that made no mention of trans issues and barely mentioned other LGBTQ+ issues. I was even, to my knowledge, one of the first few sapphic couples at my high school. The current school regulations would have made my time in public school so much happier, and I am strongly concerned to see them removed.  This regulation, specifically the roll-back of protections for transgender students and other education resources, will do KNOWN harm to students. This roll-back as disguised as protection of parent's rights, but I would like to challenge that basis. Firstly, the current regulation does nothing to prevent parents from having their own conversation with their children. If a parent does not agree with what is taught, they are more than welcome to have a different conversation outside of school. Most parents already have their own conversations with their children about religion, even when history classes cover a different viewpoint. Nothing about the current regulation forces a transgender identity on a child, but only introduces the idea of what being transgender is. The regulation roll-back prevents a conversation entirely. To block an entire field of conversation is censorship. Secondly, the regulation roll-back is said to ""promote religious freedom"". However, this only promotes Christianity's take on transgender issues. A number of other world religions respect trans identities, or have an entirely different perspective on the gender binary. Limiting gender identity only to the two sexes is a wholly christian take, and does the opposite of promoting religious freedom. I respect that the christian religion may have a different take on transgender issues than I do. However, that take has no place dominating the conversation in public schools. Finally, this regulation roll-back forcibly outs transgender students to their parents, or rolls back protections that would prevent an educator from doing so. I wish we did not live in a world where this would need to be hidden. I wish we lived in a world where being trans did not have to be a secret. I wish we lived in a world where a trans person could be open everywhere, and not have to fear being outed. However, in the world we are in now, this is an active threat to children. Outing them as trans to a hateful family is known to expose a child to violence. Parents that do not accept their children exponentially increase the likelihood of suicide. (While I know that this statistic is usually cited in favor of preventing a child from coming out, the best way to lower that number is for a person still be trans, but have an accepting support group. https://www.hrc.org/news/new-study-reveals-shocking-rates-of-attempted-suicide-among-trans-adolescen) The proposed regulation claims to promote parents' rights, but we still as a society condemn violence against children regardless or parents' opinions.   In summary, though this proposal claims to promote the freedom of parents, the freedom of speech, and the freedom of religion, it actually limits the conversation to only hate. Educating children on LGBT+ and specifically transgender issues does not force a person to be LGBT+, but provides them information on how to support others or how to love themselves. This ends the section that I expect the state agency to read and respond to, but I would like to finish with personal experience. This regulation claims to prevent one ideology from dominating public education, but limits the conversation to only cisgender, heterosexual ideas. I know this from experience, from going to VA public school before the 2021 regulations were adopted. How to be cisgender and how to be straight is already being taught to children. Gender roles and compulsory heterosexuality are inescapable in modern society. When not paired with LGBT+ education, you feel like being cisgender and straight is your only option. It was not later education on LGBT+ issues that made me non-binary and a lesbian, I was always going to have those identities in some form. However, it was learning about LGBT+ issues that taught me how to love and accept myself, in ways that I could not without them. I was always going to be non-binary and a lesbian, but learning about LGBT+ issues helped me to learn about myself. Helped me figure out why I was constantly uncomfortable presenting as a woman. Helped me to see ways I could be happier in my gender presentation. I could have been happier if I had learned about them as a child. The LGBT+ and specifically transgender students are going to continue to be trans even if you repeal these regulations. Keeping the 2021 regulations allows them to access education on themselves, and protect them from violence.

Removing that support is cruel. Requiring teachers to ""out"" students to unsupportive parents is also cruel. This policy will lead to bullying at school. It will lead to abuse at home.

Diane Sillaman ,TEACHER VIEWPOINT,"I am a retired high school math teacher. I have taught in 3 states with an estimated 2,000 or so students in total. I homeschooled my own four children and have tutored about 100 students. The power to decide what students should be taught rests squarely on the parents. The laws and Supreme Court decisions, as well as our history as a nation all support that divine operative ruling. I am so proud of Mr. Youngkin standing against the insane, woke, Marxists of our day who want Americans to believe the state has ownership of its young. Absolutely not!!! Their leftist ideologies have no place in public schools. In my view the only reason they are being pushed there is the overreach of the national level of education. This entity in combination with unions has run roughshod over sensible, good, respectful teachers, parents and principals all across our country. I am deeply committed to fighting Marxism wherever it may raise its ugly head. The state cannot, must not replace the God-ordained family. The evidence is everywhere. Who are the kids who are thriving in the USA today? Kids of intact marriages with a father in the home. The stability that a man-woman covenanted marriage union gives to the children produced by said union is far and away the best environment for the well being of children. No home is perfect, but it doesn't need to be to be substantially better than anything offered by any government.  Parents raise children, not government.",136077,9/26/22  4:17pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136077

When children are supported in their gender identity, they have (1) better developmental outcomes; (2) lower rates of depression, anxiety, substance use, and suicide; and (3) more positive social and academic outcomes at school (Day et al., 2019; Gower et al., 2018; Olson, 2016; Russell & Fish, 2016).

Dan ,Read the proposal. HARD NO.,"Virginian here. This recent proposal around trans youth in Virginia will harm them. The centering of the parents in this bill, as opposed to the CHILD, will unnecessarily out many trans youth to their parents, all of whom won't be accepting. Trans youth should feel safe at school, to openly be themselves, without fear of discrimination. For some, it is a chance to be away from home If trans youth aren't open to their parents, chances are their parents may not be accepting! We must acknowledge this and safely guide them. For many, school is a place to be away from an unaccepting home, to be in an environment that would safely accommodate them and their identities. This will not only harm trans youth, but also put another strain in the trust between the education system and those who run it, all so the Virginia government and Governor Youngkin can pat themselves on the back and say they have parents in mind. This proposal will only hurt families.   DO. NOT. PASS. THIS. BILL!",136088,9/26/22  4:17pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136088

Lindsey Martin ,No exaggeration--this policy will kill children. ,"Trans children not only deserve, but have a right, to be in a welcoming and safe school environment. This policy reinforces harmful, dangerous, baseless, and wrong stereotypes about trans people.  Trans people have, and always will, exist. Trans children have, and always will, exist. It is our job--one of our innate responsibilities as human beings--to ensure our youth grow up in a supportive environment. It is not the role of schools and teachers to push partisan beliefs that aim to bully anyone that dares to exist outside of a perceived ""norm"".  If enacted, this policy will be the direct cause of loss of life, of loss of happiness, and for the creation of immense and unnecessary pain.  Have the authors and supporters of this policy ever thought to put themselves in another person's shoes? It's a lesson I learned very young that apparently has not stuck with some people. What does a trans child do at school if not allowed to use the bathroom that aligns with their identity? We already know the many levels of violence that trans people face living their daily lives.

"Kayden Stockwell, Dept of Psychology, University of Virginia ",This policy will harm transgender children and is not supported by scientific evidence.,"As a developmental psychology PhD student, I strongly oppose this guidance. We know that transgender children who are supported and allowed to live as their identified gender do not differ from cisgender peers in their mental health (Olson et al., 2016). This is in contrast to transgender adolescents who have significantly higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidality than their cisgender peers (Clements-Nolle et al., 2006; Haas, 2011). Those adolescents, historically unlikely to have been supported to socially transition in childhood, have often experienced years of discrimination and prejudice, rejection, and dissonance between their gender identity and their body (Budge et al., 2013; Koken et al., 2009; Russell et al., 2011). Research increasingly suggests that social support, such as being called by one's preferred name, by pronouns that match their gender identity, and being allowed to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, supports transgender individuals' mental health (Bauer et al., 2015; Ryan et al., 2010; Simons et al., 2013). The policy proposed here is not in alignment with what rigorous research has shown us about how to support the health of transgender people. By preventing transgender children from accessing school in a way that aligns with their gender identity, this policy exposes children to harm and risks their mental health. By affirming policies that other transgender people, children will learn that treating transgender people differently is acceptable, increasing the risk that they develop prejudice and stigma toward an already marginalized group. As a developmental psychology PhD student, I strongly oppose these guidelines. They are not grounded in science and they do not support the healthy development of our nation's youth.",136144,9/26/22  4:20pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136144

It requires outing children to their parents if they want to have the least amount of support, even for using a nickname. As it is well known that parents of trans children may be abusive and not support their firmly held gender beliefs, this guidance promotes further harm to those children. Even for transgender children with supportive parents, this guidance would not allow those children to use the facilities according to their gender. This is discriminatory and would almost certainly cause harassment by other students. Going forward with this would cause severe harm to transgender students, with no benefits to anyone except the political careers of those pushing it.

It will negatively affect transgender teen and children’s mental health and lead to higher risks of suicide and depression. Going by a different name from their birth name is not harming anyone, and neither is using different pronouns. All it does is make the student more comfortable and confident in their own bodies.  The only thing these policies will do is kill children. Trans people will still exist, you cannot get rid of us.

Bryce ,"This policy is harmful, believe it or not. Here is why. ","For people who fully support this policy, please try to understand the perspective of the people who disagree with you. Parents should have a say in a child's upbringing, but they should not have a say in how a person identifies themself. Through my experiences as a trans person, and growing up with queer and trans youth who were closeted from their families, I understand why they wouldn't want their parents/guardians to know that aspect about them.  Not every family is always glad to hear that their child doesn't identify with the gender they were assigned. From families who are ""supportive"", but don't want their kids to be trans, to families who would literally abuse or even disown their child, or even force them to de-transition. I grew up with many trans people who knew that their home life would be harder for them if they were outed. Schools should not be responsible to report a trans kid's identity to parents in order to report their ""well-being.""  Transgender kids are not being indoctrinated. The LGBTQ+ community isn't tricking kids into being transgender. They are not ""grooming"" these children, in fact, it could be argued, that the church ""grooms"" children into NOT being trans. Trans kids are not a product of a ""Social Contagion"", nor  are they walking into hospitals getting surgeries and hormones. Most importantly, trans kids' existence should not be political; it's a human right, as these are people's very identities that are being debated. Cisgender people who don't agree with this policy don't get the hardships trans people AND trans youth have to go through in their day to day. It isn't just the ""pronoun"" issue, it's the misinformation about every aspect of them. From the villainization of trans women being predatory, to the failure to acknowledge nonbinary people's existence. All these kids want is to have a space where they can explore their gender identity and feel comfortable doing that. If a child wants to go by a different name and pronouns than what's on their birth certificate, they should be allowed to do so. If schools are comfortable to call a cis student by their preferred name/nickname, then they should be able to do the same for trans youth. Schools are not only an educational resource, but it's also a community within its doors. Kids build friendships and communities; this allows many students who identify as trans to be able to experiment with names and pronouns. They, and only they, have the power to decide on what they are comfortable being identified as, and if they want their parents to know about that part about them.  There are many things in our life that are sacred; like freedom of speech, religion, and self expression. A person's identity is just as sacred. The only people who are allowed to reveal the child's form of self-expression is the child and the child alone. It is not a schoolboard. It is not a teacher. It is not anybody else. It's all up to the child, because they are the only ones who know themselves the most.  The most important thing when it comes to the educational system isn't just the content schools teach, it is also the wellbeing of students. And if the schoolboard wants to provide a space where ALL children are supported and treated fairly, then trans youth are obligated to be treated the same, not marginalized or discriminated against. Try to understand that if you still disagree. ",136223,9/26/22  4:24pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136223

Bethany Teachman ,Strong opposition to the proposed guidelines,"I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed guidelines. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The research is clear that the mental health of transgender youth is greatly harmed when they are in environments that are not inclusive, and policies like these that restrict transgender rights may increase risk of serious psychological harm and even suicide. As noted in https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jora.12487, “school policies focused on support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning youth may reduce bias-based bullying and enhance social supports in schools.” Further, risk for mental illness is lower when transgender children are in an environment that supports them: as shown in https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/137/3/e20153223/81409/Mental-Health-of-Transgender-Children-Who-Are, “Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of children with [gender identity disorder] GID; socially transitioned transgender children have notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.” It is critical that we support LGBTQ+ students – all students win by creating environments that celebrate diversity and where all members of the community feel safe and welcome.

The policy is truly unnecessary in every right and helps neither student nor parent. Instead it is a blatant ploy to enact Anti-LGBTQ rhetoric in the Commonwealth. There is no world in which this policy benefits schools instead it allows for schools to be openly discriminatory and aggressive towards its student body.

Youngkin's attempt to violate the civil rights of transgender students by limiting them to roles and pronouns only based on their biological sex at birth, as well as limiting discussion of LGBQT issues. There are no ""improved outcomes"" for trans students under these policies. The rate of trans youth suicides will only increase as a result. Proponents of these so called ""parental rights"" falsely believe that becoming gay is somehow contagious and even rational discussion of trans/gay rights, issues, and books is dangerous.  This kind of thinking imperils the freedom of all disadvantaged individuals who do not happen to share the same values as these right-wing conservative agitators. Being unable to speak out and have their choice of pronouns ridiculed and denied is a violation of their First Amendment rights.

I stand with the vast majority of Virginia citizens and parents who want ALL kids to be treated with kindness and respect. Transgender kids already have staggeringly high rates of depression and suicide, largely because they are exposed to a hateful and unsupportive environment from childhood. Virginia schools, along with our society at large, have made great progress over the past few years in improving diversity, equity, and inclusion.  Sadly, instead of working to make classrooms and society more inclusive and welcoming for all kids, Governor Youngkin is stoking divisions in an effort to boost his profile on Fox News. It is telling that young people across Virginia are the most opposed to these guidelines, and to the governor's other policies of division and exclusion.

Transgender and nonbinary children are already at high risk, not because of their gender identity, but because they’re so often targeted by discriminatiory policies and used as political pawns by incompetent people pretending to be experts and using the excuse of being “Christians” as a reason to hate openly.  If Governor Youngkin wants to make national news and highlight non-existent issues to stoke fear among the uninformed, he should leave innocent children out of it!! This discriminatory policy should be a source of shame for anyone involved in drafting it.

Greyson Pettus ,Complete opposition to this infeasible and hateful policy,"I'm writing to strongly oppose this incredibly transphobic policy. As a nonbinary Virginian from a rural community with parents who are active educators and public school administrators, this policy is not only extremely hateful towards the LGBT+ community, but is infeasible to push onto already overworked and underpaid teachers and administrators. This policy invalidates the identity of thousands of LGBT students who already face daily discrimination, and will increase the already high rates of religious abuse, hate crimes, and homelessness due to eviction by parents on the grounds of LGBT identity that many Virginia youth face. ",136323,9/26/22  4:29pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136323

EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUAL (fc) ,I SUPPORT THIS AND ANYONE WHO OPPOSSES IT ARE TOOLS OF THE STATE ,"Our society has been plagued by many who advocate mental illnesses as legitimate bodily feelings. Whether homosexuality, transgenderism, bestiality, or other forms of morally degenerate behaviors; these ideas which have been once seen as deviant by society are now seen as usual and even proper to have. Many believe these ideas are terrible and members of such groups should not have the authority to preach their ""religion"" to feebly-minded children.  The reason I say ""religion"" is that our once morally religious nation has fallen to the ideologies of the state. Instead of reason and order, chaos and hedonism are now supported by many who hold power in this country. We see this when they hoist the gay and transgender flags over our federal buildings and force federal workers to take ""diversity, equity, and inclusion"" classes. They have created a state where no one can freely opinionate their thoughts on a liberal level without getting bullied and slandered by their bosses, co-workers, friends, family, and the masses around them. No one is allowed to think, they are only allowed to consume information and vomit it out in a way acceptable to the state. The religion of chaos the state has led and will lead to a continual societal downfall where we have no power and they have all the power. We will not fight it because we don't know how to. The next generations are doomed to be unknowing slaves to the state and its religions. When you are weak you cannot fight back This comes to the policies in our schools, adolescents are easily moved to believe in anything told to them. They have not developed a moral conscience and cannot decipher truth from false and right from wrong. The state has seen that and has gorged them with these chaotic ideas. Predictably, this is extremely effective because the youth have been strongly indoctrinated with these ideas of homosexuality, transgenderism, race theories, and hedonistic moralities. Creating a weak society where many are unable to rationally and freely think organically. Moreover, the purpose of school is to teach the youths how to think and not what to think. Academia has once been an epicenter where privileged individuals flocked for the purpose and love of learning. Now it is a wasteland of state-sponsored, propangandic pamphlets that have made our next generations morally weak and unable to critically think. The state should have no right to do so and I support any bill or legislation stripping religious powers away from the state including this one.",136326,9/26/22  4:29pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136326

Transgender people suffer the highest rates of suicidal ideation - and follow-through on same - of any other sub group, and this is particularly so for transgender people of color. It is backwards and wrong to take any state action to lessen the rights and protections for these most vulnerable students in our schools.  While it is true that parents ought to guide and protect their children, particularly in recent years is has become more apparent that many, many parents are failing their kids. It is irrelevant if a parent feels the fact of their child being born gay, transgender, or otherwise is somehow in opposition to that parent's personal or ""religious"" beliefs - to repress or otherwise prevent such kids from receiving affirmation according to their stated needs is demonstrably, factually damaging - it is child abuse, pure and simple.

Jeanne M. McKeon ,Look at the data and care for our youth when providing GUIDANCE,"Suicidality Among Transgender Youth: Elucidating the Role of Interpersonal Risk Factors - Abstract  (Italics and bolded font added by this commenter.) Data indicate that 82% of transgender individuals have considered killing themselves and 40% have attempted suicide, with suicidality highest among transgender youth. Using minority stress theory and the interpersonal theory of suicide, this study aims to better understand suicide risk among transgender youth. The present study examines the influence of intervenable risk factors: interpersonal and environmental microaggressions, internalized self-stigma, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and protective factors: school belonging, family support, and peer support on both lifetime suicide attempts and past 6-month suicidality in a sample of transgender youth (n = 372). SPSS 22 was utilized to examine the impact of the independent variables on both suicidality and lifetime suicide attempt through two separate logistic regressions. Fifty six percent of youth reported a previous suicide attempt and 86% reported suicidality. Logistic regressions indicated that models for both lifetime suicide attempts and suicidality were significant. Interpersonal microaggressions, made a unique, statistically significant contribution to lifetime suicide attempts and emotional neglect by family approached significance. School belonging, emotional neglect by family, and internalized self-stigma made a unique, statistically significant contribution to past 6-month suicidality. Results have significant practice and policy implications. Findings offer GUIDANCE for practitioners working with parents and caregivers of trans youth, as well as, for the creation of practices which foster interpersonal belonging for transgender youth.",136387,9/26/22  4:32pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136387

Betsy Lee ,Against proposed anti-LBGTQ student policies,"I find it appalling that Gov Youngkin is trying to burnish his MAGA bona fides and feed his political ambitions by promoting a policy designed to harm LGBTQ students.    The parent who objects to treating these students with respect and compassion is likely the kind of parent who has none. ""Parental rights"" in this context basically assumes that parents have a right to shame their child or ""beat the gay"" out of them.   Supportive parents do not object to LGBTQ-friendly policies.  No one's sexuality is created by alleged ""grooming"", which is apparently the new right-wing buzz word to frighten parents.  Sneering comments implying LGBTQ children are simply flirting with a lifestyle rather than being their true selves betrays ignorance of reality. Making school a welcoming and tolerant environment only encourages children to be who they really are.  That is what a parent should want.  If you want your child to go to an anti-LGBTQ school, there are plenty of ""Christian"" schools that will be happy to shelter them from the real world.  ",136402,9/26/22  4:33pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136402

Tom Does Memes ,Some of Eco’s 14 Points on Fascism,"1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.” 2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.” 5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”12. Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.” 13. Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.” 14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”",136417,9/26/22  4:33pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136417

Anonymous ,STOP the WOKENESS in our Public Schools! EDUCATE not INDOCTRINATE! Back to Common Sense!,"DO NOT allow pronouns to be used in our schools. This only leads to confusing the children more. There are ONLY two genders, male & female based on the male chromosome or the female chromosome. What happened to “follow the science”? Bathroom use & sports activities need to be limited to appropriate biological gender, again as defined by the appropriate chromosomes and nothing else! Common sense should tell you that just because a boy “identifies” as a girl, if he was allowed to compete in girls sports it would not be fair as the boy would still be , biologically stronger than the girl even though he may “identify” as a girl. Transgender and LGBTQ should NOT be promoted or encouraged in our public schools by teachers, staff or other officials. These are MENTAL HEALTH issues and should not be addressed by the Public School system! STOP enabling and coddling these children. To do so is not helping them. They need to grow up and learn how to function in the real world and not the world of make believe (“you can be any gender or animal or whatever you want to be” nonsense) that many in our Public School system are promoting. And there should be TRANSPARENCY (the ONLY “Trans” in schools) between the schools and the parents! There shouldn’t be anymore secrets or matters withheld from parents. It’s the parents responsibility to raise their children and not the schools! The schools responsibility it to EDUCATE the children and NOT indoctrinate them!

Rev. Amanda Hendler-Voss ,As Parent & Pastor: Please Protect Trans Kids!,"Governor Youngkin's draft model policy will harm families, parents and kids alike, and as a parent and a pastor, I urge you to reject it. Such a policy threatens the mental health of trans kids, who are statistically more likely to resort to suicide or other self-harming measures when they cannot live and be recognized in the gender identity they have determined is authentic to them. Ideally, such a determination happens in concert with supportive, loving parents, but this is not always the case. In fact we know that a disproportionate number of homeless youth and young adults are on the streets because their parents have rejected their gender or sexual identity. To force the teachers and counselors tasked to educate our children and youth to ""out them"" to their parents in a home where it's not safe is to place children in danger. To prohibit teachers from supporting trans students in ways they feel called or committed to is to create a hostile educational environment. As a pastor I have ministered to youth who cannot safely use the bathroom all day at school or have opted out of school lunch or library because their chosen name and pronouns are not honored. The level of anxiety these situations cause is a determent to learning and to the mental health and wellbeing of a child.

Stephanie Mancini ,Loudoun parent-strongly oppose this anti-trans policy ,"Both of my children went through their entire school careers in Loudoun county, graduating in 2018 and 2021. They both have friends and acquaintances who identify as trans or non-binary. There has never been an issue with teachers accepting preferred names and pronouns, thankfully. It's outrageous and appalling that you want LBGT students to be force -outed, to be dead named and disrespected as the state's default position. Should we have listened to parents who refused to desegregate our schools? No, we should not have. Denying basic human rights to students who just want to live is heinous. After the Supreme Court decision for Gavin Grimm, I admit I'm surprised you're foolish enough to go down this road again.

Anonymous ,Protect Trans Youth,"The new policies regarding trans students pose great harm for no benefit. It is unnecessary to take time out of teachers days to call home about a students identity. The job of a teacher is to educate. Their job is not to use their time inform parents of every detail about their child unless they are a danger to themselves or others. If this policy were to be implemented every student who’s legal name was Benjamin but wanted to go by Ben would need to go through a whole tedious process just to use a name they have gone by for years.    School is a time for experimentation and figuring out who people are, by limiting students ability to safely discover themselves it leads to higher rates of depression and anxiety. If parents are not supportive of the LGBTQIA+ community and the student is a part of it, they might be afraid of being kicked out or abused. School provides a safe space for students to try things if that is not the case at home. The argument that using preferred name and pronouns may go against teachers beliefs is futile as it may go against another teachers belief to report a student for wanting to use a different name. Fundamentally the new policy is being used as an excuse to discriminate against LGBTQIA+ students. Safety should be the first priority of schools and in some cases students are in danger if their parents are aware of their gender identity.    I fight that this policy does not go into action.",136518,9/26/22  4:38pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136518
Anonymous ,Agree with Change ,"Agree with this change of policy. Children under the age of 18 are still minors in the eyes of the law, so a parent should be involved in this process. The VDH Guidelines for Healthcare  in Classroom Page 6 states that ""parents have the primary responsibility for providing appropriate health care for their children."" Not the school teacher, the school counselor or the school administration.  What are all of the people opposing this change really afraid of? Why are they afraid of a parent being informed or involved?  Seems like this really isnt a transgender issue for them but anti-authority and anti establishment issue. ",136519,9/26/22  4:38pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136519

Julia von Briesen ,I am a mental health provider to youth and I absolutely oppose this proposed legislation,"It is unfathomable to me that a child's ability to feel safe being themselves in school is being potentially compromised BY LAW. When a child is exploring their identity, they ought to be in charge of who and how they get to navigate it. Research shows that the support of one--yes ONE--adult in a kid's life, especially for non-cisgender youth, is hugely protective against suicidal ideation and attempts. School is one domain to which youth have access to peers and adults who could be part of this support and prevention measure, particularly when family ideologies might not support the youth at home. In my line of work as a mental health provider for youth, confidentiality is one of the biggest reasons kids feel safe disclosing information that ultimately gets them access to the support they need. To force disclosure of private information could become not only dangerous to youth but could create barriers to them feeling safe asking for help and support when they need it. I urge you to consider that youth have enough safety concerns that are out of their control at schools right now (I live in Charlottesville and there were TWO incidents last week related to threats of gun violence in school) and they need all the protective factors we can give them to keep them in school, learning. To learn, the brain and body need to feel safe. Let's keep them safe versus threatening the core of their agency, self-determination and idenity.",136528,9/26/22  4:38pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136528

I believe this is simply a poorly conceived effort on the administration’s behalf to mimic the dogma that other states have attempted to implement, solely for our Governor to have made some impression on the voters or the media.

Some of them are not safe to be their true selves at home, and with the previous policy there was a chance that they could be accepted for who they truly are at school (it seems many schools were working with trans and nonbinary students to use their correct names and pronouns). Trans students won't be allowed to play sports; that hurts the entire sports community. And all kids will see that Virginia schools stand behind not accepting people for who they truly are, and perhaps they will think it's the right thing to do too, which leads to even more harm for trans and nonbinary students. This is despicable. If this is truly about parent rights, please take my parental rights into account. I want all kids to be accepted for who they truly are at school. I do not want hate to have a place in the school my kid attends. The policy that was already passed on this is inclusive and allows kids to be who they truly are at school.

Robin skobel ,This policy sanctions discrimination ,"In regards to your recent education policy release, I would like to point out several inconsistencies.Your policy states:“Schools shall defer to parents to make the best decisions with respect to their children: Parents are in the best position to work with their children and, where appropriate, their children’s health care providers to determine (a) what names, nicknames, and/or pronouns, if any, shall be used for their child by teachers and school staff while their child is at school, (b) whether their child engages in any counseling or social transition at school that encourages a gender that differs from their child’s sex, or (c) whether their child expresses a gender that differs with their child’s sex while at school.”Therefore, if a child with parental support requests to be addressed with specific pronouns, a teacher must defer to the parent. When this very circumstance occurred recently in Loudon County VA, you sided with the teacher misgendering a child not the parents who wanted the teacher to honor their child’s request. How is that stance deferring to parents? You cannot both support a teacher who says “their religion compels them to ignore preferred pronouns” while at the same time following your own policy which compels schools to view parents as the best decision makers with respect to their child. It appears in practice, you and your policy support the person who aligns with the beliefs that transgender youth should be devalued and misgendered using religion to usurp parental rights. Which brings us to your next point…. .Your policy states:“These 2022 Model Policies adhere to the First Amendment. The First Amendment forbids government actors to require individuals to adhere to or adopt any particular ideological beliefs. Practices such as compelling others to use preferred pronouns is premised on the ideological belief that gender is a matter of personal choice or subjective experience, not sex. Many Virginians reject this belief. Additionally, the First Amendment guarantees religious freedom and prohibits compelling others to affirm ideas that may be contrary to their personal religious beliefs.”Many school activities are held on Friday nights and Saturdays. These include: football games, graduations, standardized tests, mandatory review sessions, theatre shows and many more school events. As Jewish woman, my children were forced to choose between their religious practices and participation in school events, both academic and extracurricular, many mandatory. Your freedom of religion statement is only geared toward the religion to which you adhere. Where does one person’s freedom end so another’s can begin? If my children had not participated in school-based activities occurring on Friday afternoons/evenings or Saturdays they would not have attended: graduation, taken required tests to include AP, college entrance, or participated in any extracurricular activities related to school-- all which would impede their acceptance to college as well as significantly impact their high school performance. Yet none of these events or activities occurred on Sundays. In your policy, freedom of religion is based in the Christian view of religion—it does not account for any other.Your policy states:“Schools shall respect all students: All children in Virginia have a right to learn, free from unlawful discrimination and harassment. School division policies shall therefore implement the requirements of the Act in a manner that ensures no student is discriminated against or harassed on the basis of his or her sex. To this end, local school division policies shall implement the requirements of the Act in a manner that demonstrates respect for each student”.For as long as many of us can remember, on the first day of school, when teachers confirm their rosters they ask, “What do you prefer to be called?” Your policy is a direct result of bias against students who are transgender. If it were the case that teachers no longer have to respect student’s wishes, then NO child should be allowed to determine what they prefer to be called. Theodore will be Theodore, Alexandra will be Alexandra. No Teddy. No Alex. No being called by your middle name. By only allowing some children to choose what they will be called you are not adhering to your above statement that schools shall respect ALL children. Your policy states:“As a part of that work, educators strive to meet the individual needs of all students entrusted to their care, and teachers work to create educational environments where all students thrive. The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying.”When a teacher refuses to use students’ preferred pronouns, citing religious beliefs, they are certainly NOT ensuring “All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying”. You are validating an adult discriminating against a student as well as setting an example for others to bully, harass and discriminate against said student. You are absolutely not “recognizing students as unique individuals…that should be valued and respected”. You are telling each student who they are, what is and is not acceptable and that their value is dependent on the belief systems of someone else.This policy is riddled with hypocrisy. In your quest to disenfranchise transgender students you have engineered a policy feigning acceptance that is clearly duplicitous. Your policy states schools should “defer to parents to make the best decisions for their child”, that “Schools shall respect all students: All children in Virginia have a right to learn, free from unlawful discrimination and harassment”. The policy claims “The Virginia Department of Education …recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying”. All the above policies paint a picture of acceptance. However, the final element, that “These 2022 Model Policies adhere to the First Amendment. The First Amendment forbids government actors to require individuals to adhere to or adopt any particular ideological beliefs” this is the foundation you use to invalidate all other aspects of this policy. Your acceptance that someone’s religion makes it impossible to use the name or pronouns students prefer is nothing more than a veiled rationalization for favoring one person’s beliefs over another’s. While it could easily be debated no religion actually directs people be required to maintain the sex and gender pronouns they were born with, what is really at issue here, is your aligning with those who share your biased beliefs, rather than really enforcing religious freedom for all. As cited above, when these policies have been put to the test, you have shown your support only if the student, parent or teacher is espousing beliefs that are gender normative and seeded in “Christian” dogma, thereby superseding all other religions and all other aspects of this policy. These policies are, at their core, discriminatory. Though your language is couched in equality and religious freedom, in practice this policy sanctions the exact opposite.Robin Skobel, MEd",136633,9/26/22  4:44pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136633

Grey Webbert ,I oppose this vehemently. This will directly lead to the suicide of trans-kids.,"Response to: Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools This is not only disgusting, it's just downright cruel. I am transgender myself, am currently going through all legal processes in this state (Virginia), and if this passed while I was in  high school the likelihood that some of my friends would have committed suicide is not something to laugh at. My best friend came out as trans in middle school, and had a terribly abusive and un-accepting family. The only place he could be out was at school, and that continued into high school. Many of us are repressed our entire lives until we finally decide to do something about it. Many of us, those of us who figure it out younger, are only able to be open about our own identity at school especially if our parents and immediate family will have none of it and don't believe or understand us. This is especially true if they are religious (christian, catholic, southern baptist, etc.). All we want to do is exist, and be safe. Trans kids are much less likely to attempt suicide if they have even just one adult who supports them in their life, and many of us get that from confiding in trusted teachers at school who don't judge us and support us. The fact of the matter is, more of us who are trans and young have more supporting adults at school than we will at home in our immediate families. School is a safe haven, and this legislation will quite literally rip away that safety and make it just like any other place for trans people in unaccepting spaces - it will become a place of constant harassment and aggression. That's not an environment any queer teen would want to learn in. Forcing even supportive teachers to out the kids they care about and teach is downright cruel as well, especially since the reason trans kids choose not to be out to their parents is because in all likelihood it is NOT SAFE TO BE. You will be taking away the support trans kids need to keep themselves afloat. This will, undoubtedly, lead to a spike in trans kids suicide rates in Virginia. I am in utter disbelief. You will have failed thousands of kids and will have directly contributed to worsening their living conditions, if they are even alive at all after the end of this. Do better. Don't pass this. These kids have no power and are our most vulnerable. They don't deserve this.",136644,9/26/22  4:45pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136644

Anonymous ,Oppose. This policy harms kids and the Commonwealth!,"School must be a safe place for children. This policy does nothing but harm and be cruel to the children trying to figure out who they are. It puts underpaid and overworked teachers into the position of (once again) lawyer, doctor, and parent as they have to arbitrate what the correct name is for the child, how the child can express themselves, and how the child must act to follow this policy and avoid frivolous punishment. It does not help children, save for those who want another excuse to bully. There will still be trans kids if you implement this policy. You're making their young lives hell, but they will still be trans, regardless of what you do.   The Commonwealth is harmed as good employees and businesses are driven away by policies that will harm themselves or their children. You're so proud of getting LEGO to come to Chesterfield? They came because Virginia was more inclusive than North Carolina (Chesterfield Observer). Do you think they're happy about their decision now? Do you think any other companies with sterling reputations like LEGO will join them?

It is clear that Youngkin has no respect for transgender individuals, including kids, who are at the greatest risk of harm. If the parents of a child do not know that they identify as transgender, it is likely because their parents, either will not support it, or they fear harm at the hands of their parents. Regardless, parents cannot dictate a child’s gender or sexual orientation – it is truly an individualized reality, not one that could be an imposed on an individual by anyone else. Youngkin’s decisions remind me  of efforts in the past to strip away the rights of other groups. It is a message of hatred and intolerance, and not some thing that should be supported or passed in the commonwealth of Virginia.

"Claire A, SWVA ",Horrific and backwards policy. Completely oppose ,"This policy is monstrous and is not what Virginians want for our state or our schools.  If adopted, it will cause real and tangible harm to children. This policy flies in the face of decades of sound and accepted scientific research which supports that stigmatization puts transgender children at risk for suicide, abuse, and becoming victims of physical violence (Russell, S. T., & Fish, J. N. 2016). Trans children are less likely to have parental support and affirmation than other LGB children, and forcing these children to either remain closeted or to be outed is cruel (Ryan et al. (2010).  Additionally, the detrimental impact of homophobic and transphobic school environments are not unique to LGBTQ+ youth, and research has identified detrimental impacts of homophobia within schools on the mental wellbeing of heterosexual youth as well (Poteat et al. 2011, Robinson & Espelage 2012).  Furthermore, we know that transgender students who are supported and affirmed have better mental health outcomes. As noted in Olson, Durwood, & McLaughlin, 2016: ""Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within this group. Especially striking is the comparison with reports of children with GID; socially transitioned transgender children have notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.""  This bill will hurt children, and it is abhorrent that their safety in school is less important to the governor than political capital.  Further reading: Day, J.K., Fish, J.N., Grossman, A.H. and Russell, S.T.

Anonymous ,Fully support this common sense policy!,"I fully support this common-sense policy which keeps parents in the driver's seat when it comes to things that affect their children at school. I think we're headed down a very slippery slope when it comes to the care of children. It is not the government's job to raise children, but the parent(s). Now if there's a problem of abuse or neglect, then the government can step in to support. It's not the school's job to provide medical care. That should be between the student and their trusted doctor who has been chosen and vetted by the family. Teachers are not trained psychologists so this should not fall on them. Unfortunately, in Fairfax County, there are very few trained psychologists in schools. It would be nice if each subschool in high schools had at least one, but sadly that is not the case. Why are schools catering to such a small portion of the student population? There needs to be a happy medium here to make everyone happy and I believe that most of the people who oppose this policy have not even read it in its entirety.",136756,9/26/22  4:51pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136756

No we want to fight instead because we like that and this is killing our kids.  I wish parents could really see the reality in our high schools and middle, which is WORSE than high school.  We have to administer NARCAN on the daily, and all the parents care about in here is that some people don't want a transgender child to be in the bathroom with their child who isn't.  That's disgusting and I hope anyone who reads this will consider actually READING the policy and understand that what it says is that the school system's job is to protect ALL children but their mission is education NOT parenting children or helping children to hide secrets from their parents.    Governor Youngkin, thank you, thank you, thank you....   ",136790,9/26/22  4:53pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136790

Anonymous ,Strong Opposition to this Policy Change,"I strongly oppose this policy change for the risk it poses to the well-being and safety of transgender/gender non-conforming children. The existence of transgender and gender non-conforming children is not a matter of politics, nor an ideological belief. It is a scientific fact! Gender roles and presentation have been fluid across cultures and time periods throughout the entirety of human history with very few constants. Using religious freedom as an excuse for the practices outlined in this policy change is flimsy at best. Most religions don't have much to say about the transgender community, and are very rarely negative about it. There are only a few contemporary denominations of with strong negative opinions. Accommodating for a few denominations, over the thousands of religions being practiced today, seems as though it would infringe on the religious freedom of more people by making this policy change.  By ""deferring to parents..."" and ""keeping parents informed...""  you are firstly denying a child's autonomy and sense of self. You are secondly denying them their discretion. In the current political climate, as unfortunate as it is, the simple sociological concept of gender and sex being different things from one another has been known in some cases, to elicit hostile responses among reactionary people, on occasion, to a violent extent. If the parents of transgender/gender non-conforming children are themselves reactionary, the knowledge of their child's gender identity could create a hostile home environment, putting the child at risk of emotional, verbal, or even physical abuse.     ",136801,9/26/22  4:53pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136801

Lucy Gray ,"These policies don’t support parental rights, they support discrimination and bullying","Trans students are already at higher risk of bullying, mental health issues, suicide, and depression. These policies will only worsen what trans kids have to endure. By forcing kids to use bathrooms and facilities that they are uncomfortable with and don’t belong in, and by allowing teachers and peers to purposefully and maliciously use the wrong names and pronouns for students, these policies severely threaten the lives, rights, and wellbeing of transgender youth and students in Virginia. The supposed purpose of “parental rights” in education is merely a facade - this is a clear action against the privacy and safety of transgender students. Schools should be a place where students are able to grow and be safe in understanding themselves, without the stress and fear of constant bullying, trans students included. Forcing counselors to out students to their parents will make transgender students who will not be safe if their parents learn that they are transgender unable to receive support. Trans people cannot choose their gender, and forcing them to hide who they undeniably (and scientifically!) are at school and at home has been shown to lead to worse outcomes and increased rates of depression and suicide for trans kids.

What the governor seeks to do here is force vulnerable children who wish to set themselves apart and find their own fulfillment, away from the impositions of other people, to -conform- to a reductive and simplistic view of what is ""acceptable"". It is a cruel denial of freedoms most of us take for granted - the right to present ourselves and move in the world as we please, unbothered by tyrants. Instead of extending these freedoms to the most meek among us, the governor seeks to institute a not only a nanny state, but a nanny that prefers to thwap with the switch and spy on their charges rather than nurturing development and fostering their unique talents and treasures. Rest assured that the public will not forget this despicable policy, whether or not it goes into effect; I certainly will not. I voice my opposition firmly and demand that its implementation be cancelled immediately.",136804,9/26/22  4:53pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136804

My biggest issue with this model policy is that it leaves no room for schools to protect LGBT kids in cases of potential abuse at home. Schools outing students to their parents will lead to kids being kicked out of their homes, being beaten by their parents, and/or commiting suicide.   Teenagers being made homeless is a bad thing. Policy that increases the likelihood of teenagers becoming homeless is bad policy.   Teenagers being beaten by their parents is a bad thing.

Charlotte Volpe ,This policy puts children in danger ,"I am a graduate of Virginia’s public schools and I am fiercely opposed to this policy. I am openly LGBTQ and firmly believe that all children, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, should feel safe in public schools. If they do not feel safe enough to be out at home, that is the parents’ fault, and certainly not something for teachers or other school staff to disclose without the student’s permission. In fact, disclosure could be dangerous — I know people who have been physically abused and thrown out of their homes after being outed (or coming out) to their parents. And as someone who goes out and about on a regular basis, I could care less what’s between the legs of the person in the next restroom stall, as long as they flush and wash their hands. People claim that trans people in restrooms are predators, when in reality they are more likely to be victims of assault, including sexual assault, if they cannot use the restrooms that they feel most comfortable in. Wrapping up, children deserve to be safe, and if this policy is enacted it will do nothing but harm LGBTQ youths in the Commonwealth.

Those that would indoctrinate the children with their perverted ideologies have long wanted to separate the parents from having a say in the education of their children so that they can push the children into believing ideologies that go against the Christian principles and political beliefs of the parents. There is no other reason to oppose giving parents more voice in the process other than those that wish to separate the minds of the children from the minds of the parents.  ,136838,9/26/22  4:55pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136838
Jason Baer ,Hurting trans kids,This proposed policy will have a negative impact on trans kids and their families. Trans kids are already at a high risk for suicide and forcing them to go through this new policy only makes it tougher for them. This policy change also does not help non-trans kids because it teaches them to fear people who are different from them. The Bible clearly says to love everyone and treat everyone with respect. The trans community is very small and making them go through this onerous process simply to use a restroom is unnecessary. Let trans kids go to the bathroom of the gender they identify with and at most require them to work with a school guidance counselor. However parents do not need to be involved. Trans kids may not have supportive parents and therefore they do not need to be contacted by the school. Have a heart.   Any notion that trans kids want to get into the bathroom of the opposite sex simply to molest or assault someone is crazy. What they want to do is use the restroom like anyone else and if someone is assaulted then that should be treated like any other crime. This doesn’t need to be spelled out just for trans kids.

Anonymous ,Why do you want to hurt children?,"I strongly oppose this new guidance. Trans kids already face higher rates of abuse and suicide than their cis peers, and forcing them to be called something they’re not and outing them to potentially abusive parents is only going to make them worse. They’re children. If you truly believe being trans is “just a phase”, then let them do it. They’re figuring out who they are. Several of my LGBTQ friends were only out at school because they feared getting kicked out of the house if they were true to themselves at home. All children should feel safe to be themselves when they go to school. I don’t care if you want trans rights or not, no one should support a bill that hurts children.

Christine Smith Oxford ,Strongly oppose,"As a retired educator, I am strongly opposed to the Virginia Department of Education's 2022 Model Policies on the Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students and Parents in Virginia's Public Schools. School is the only safe place for many students, especially those whose sexual orientation may be different from that their parents/guardians might prefer. These students are often marginalized at home, beaten, punished, even thrown out of their homes by those who should protect them. Please do not cause more harm to these children by forcing school personnel to potentially out them. I have another concern about these policies. School personnel are mandated reporters of suspected abuse. As such, they MUST report any suspected abuse to Child Protective Services. Therefore, these mandated reporters will be required by law to report comments which might indicate a violent reaction made by a parent or guardian on learning that their child's orientation is different than they believed. I would like to see some assurances that the outed child will be protected by the State as would the reporting educator. Please re-think this cruel policy to protect ALL our children. ",136890,9/26/22  4:58pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136890

Christine West ,Do not implement this guidance,"This is in regard to ""Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools"" - this guidance is inherently biased against transgender and nonbinary children, and not only will the emotional well-being of children's lives be affected negatively if it's implemented, but their physical well-being would be as well.  A recent study by GLSEN concluded that ""75% of transgender youth feel unsafe at school, and those who are able to persevere had significantly lower GPAs, were more likely to miss school out of concern for their safety, and were less likely to plan on continuing their education.""  If we want all of our children to thrive in Virginia schools, we cannot single out cis gendered children as the only ones that we deem worth ""protecting"".   Please DO NOT implement this guidance as directed by the office of the Governor. It will only hurt Virginia children (trans and cis alike), and create a hostile environment for children just trying to learn, grow, and be themselves. We must protect ALL children in Virginia schools, and ensure a safe learning environment with every opportunity. Thank you.

Anonymous ,Fully Support Parental Rights,"I am in full support of this guidance of the treatment of transgender students in Virginia Public Schools. I do not believe that the wants of such a small percentage of the student population in Virginia, should supersede the needs/wants of the majority of students. Why should my 14 yr old daughter have to use the same locker room or bathroom with a boy who may expose their private parts to her? Why should my daughter feel uncomfortable changing in the girls locker room because a biological boy is in her locker room and staring at her while she is changing? Many parents, including me, send their child to school to learn academics. Not to worry about being disciplined if they call a fellow student by the wrong pronoun or think someone is a boy when they have decided to be a girl. This is very confusing for children. They are at school to learn algebra, English, computers,and biology. They are not there to be exposed to transgender ideology and question their gender. Teachers are in schools to teach. Not to worry if they are calling a student by the proper name or pronoun.  I am sympathetic towards transgender children. I cannot imagine the psychological pain they are suffering. Many studies have been done that show transgenders grow out of this stage and eventually transition back to their sex at birth. I believe schools should have a list of resources outside the school available for these students. I believe the parents of transgender students under 18 yrs old have a right to know what is going on with their child wherever they are. It is their parental right. Wouldn't you want to know? If there is abuse at home, schools can help them contact the authorities. Again, I feel sorry for transgender kids but my child should not be put in a situation where she can be exposed to male genitalia or feel uncomfortable. Transgender students' parents, doctors and mental health professionals need to work together to help the transgender child.     ",136985,9/26/22  5:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=136985

Avarstia Owain ,Bad Policy will cause more worry over satisfaction,"I may not be a resident of Virginia but I am a transwoman from a state who has policies like this usually in mind, and simply to say this will simply harm more than those who want it think it will help. This is an issue that is similar to the fostercare and adoption system in the US, this would be a way where children who do not feel safe with being out publically will either be kicked out from home and or be abused by parents who are stuck in the mindset of a parent from the 1970s. What Youngkin's law plans to put in place is just further stating the danger transpeople are often in but making it more common as its supported by the state. and guess what, laws like this often are things that lead to either protests that the government wishes to silence or refugee crisises given laws against the LGBT are often stepping stones to worse actions. After a wave of Transphobic ideas got put into law, Roe v. Wade was overturn and with more trans rights being taken away it will just be a stepping stone for the worse. Spain, Italy, Germany, and a couple other countries post World War One had similar backlashes in times of compression that the US is currently being put through, and laws like this were often passed and well, history shows the path that line treads, but unlike then, due to the internet people show their more of their true colors, and a lot of people want to help others and a lot of people will pass on information so ignorance is less seen as long as you look in the right places. Laws like this are really only supported by those who deny the attrocities done by the states of the world as well as those who blindly support these groups no matter what, so I suggest unless the worse is wanted to be continued, that this law should not pass.",137035,9/26/22  5:06pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137035

Sandra Parks ,I oppose the Youngkin  transgender policy ,"Child development research indicates it is important for students to develop autonomy, and the Youngkin policy  completely negates any chance for a transgender child to have any say in their own identity. As such, it leads these vulnerable open to increased mental health crises. Generally, if a student has not come out to their family, they do not feel safe doing so. Most districts work with the student and the counselors to identify family safety and vulnerability for the student, with the goal being to involve the parents. A cold call from a teacher will put students at risk. This policy cancels any possibility of these students feeling safe at school, and research also shows that unsafe students cannot learn effectively.  This policy is a needless stab at a vulnerable population.

Joan E Fletcher ,Shame shame shame on Youngkin. He must be stopped. ,The new transgender guidelines that Gov. Youngin is proposing is outrageous. He isn't treating each student as a person that is intelligent and able to think for themselves. He is going to create even more division and hatred against LGBTQ students which is NOT what the schools need. Where is his Christianity? It is important to provide safe schools for every child and not try to create divisions among students that are different from others. One of my concerns is what will Youngin do next if he is able to stop providing safe schools for transgender students. It is all too similar to Nazi Germany. Once we allow certain types of people to not have rights then we are stepping back into time. This can not be passed in Virginia. It is shameful that he believes everyone should share his beliefs.

Marianne - Alexandria Parent ,Cruelty Should Not Be The Point ,"My family strongly opposes this discriminatory policy. To intentionally - and knowingly- harm innocent children who are trying to figure out who they are is callous and cruel. Why do you need to pick on children? To not even respect them enough to call them by their chosen name? Why be so heartless?  Trans children are much more likely to harm themselves and suffer enough slings and arrows as they are growing up, now having their schools be places that want to harm and bully them is, we submit, unlawful and discriminatory.  Treating trans children in this cruel way - in order to try to score cheap political points - is horrific. Gender fluid people have existed throughout history, and instead of trying to make innocent young people suffer, I'd prefer my taxpayer money going to find ways to support them, their families, and their schools embrace love, compassion, and community.  As Dr. Martin Luther King said: ""I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.""   God has created each and every one of us, including these children, whether or not you agree with their life choices.

Whether or not you believe that trans and nonbinary children are old enough to know their gender identity (though research suggests that many may know as young as 4 years of age,) it is blatantly harmful to reject them for it, and to forcibly out them to their parents regardless of whether it will lead to abuse. ""Every child"" includes trans children. As a teacher, I am very concerned that this policy will lead to the abuse of innocent students, and to higher suicide rates among already vulnerable populations.

Anonymous ,I oppose these policies ,"The 2022 VDOE Model Policies are inherently in opposition to the basic humans rights of LGBTQ+ youth, specifically trans and nonbinary youth. These policies, written under the guise of protecting parents' rights, exist to put children in danger in an environment that should keep them safe from home abuse, depression, anxiety, and bullying, to name a few negative outcomes. These policies also ignore the rights of the parents of trans and nonbinary youth, who seek to work alongside their school faculty to make school a safe space for their children-- these policies make it so that nonbinary identities (currently recognized in the state of Virginia as a legal gender identity) aren't recognized in schools, and make it so that children are recognized by their birth sex, which can be biologically and socially inaccurate. LGBTQ+ youth is a population that commonly experiences abuse at home, as well as homelessness-- due to unsupportive families whose beliefs do not ""allow"" for their children to identify differently than what was assigned to them at birth. These statistics can easily be found online. For the VDOE to completely ignore these facts and to mandate policies that WILL- not can, but WILL- lead to more children in danger, is inexcusable. Statistics from a poll run by The Trevor Project show that 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth and 1 in 3 cisgender youth. 14% of LGBTQ youth attempted suicide in the past year, including nearly 1 in 5 transgender and nonbinary youth and 1 in 10 cisgender youth. 73% of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety , including more than three-quarters of transgender and nonbinary youth and nearly two-thirds of cisgender youth. 58% of LGBTQ youth reported experiencing symptoms of depression. Fewer than 1 in 3 transgender and nonbinary youth found their home to be gender-affirming, while LGBTQ youth who found their school to be LGBTQ-affirming reported lower rates of attempting suicide. By implementing these policies, you are statistically putting more youth at risk, not protecting them. ",137092,9/26/22  5:09pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137092

ArQ ,Strongly support protection for ALL children,"I strongly support this commonsense proposal that treats all children with respect and dignity AND respects parental rights to be engaged in ALL aspects of their child's education.  There are unique and identifiable male and female characteristics that must be recognized and upheld.  It is not appropriate for boys to be allowed to play in girls sports, nor is it appropriate for boys to be allowed in girls private spaces.   What happened in Loudon County, when a boy, who identified as a girl, sexually assaulted 2 girls, at 2 different schools, is why it is so important to protect our daughter's right to safe, private spaces.  However, for the children that are convinced that they are the opposite gender, they should be accommodated too-with private spaces of their own.   Additionally, no one should be forced to use language that they disagree with.  Refusing to call someone by a pronoun that does not align with their innate biology, should not be a crime.   THere is  way forward, but those on the opposing side must realize that they do not have the right to force anyone to act against their conscience, by insisting that affirmation is the only position tolerated. That is not tolerance.  ",137175,9/26/22  5:13pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137175

Jocelyn ,"2022 Model Policies on Privacy, Dignity, and Respect for All Students...","I do not support the 2022 version of the Model Policies as they remove rights and freedoms for our children in schools. I question the purpose of these policies. Think back to your teachers calling out roll on the first day of school. They say, ""When I call your name, let me know if you have a nickname you prefer to go by."" So, now under the 2022 Model Policies, if Robert Junior has been going by Buddy since he was born, he needs parent written permission. What a waste of time for both teachers and parents. And, this is a practical point. What about students having the freedom to express themselves and who they want to be on their own? Children are individuals, not property of their parents. The 2022 Model Policies are not an advancement in our human interactions as a society, but representative of a decline in thinking. I provide these specifics for consideration, as I can see others are commenting with expressions of outrage, and I would like to share some points in my comments as reasons for my similarly appalled feelings about the direction of the policies.

"George, Parent of a gay child ",I oppose this change,"As the parent of a daughter who came out, I strongly oppose this policy.  She was afraid to come out to my wife and I because she was afraid that she would not be accepted any longer by us.  That was a totally unfounded fear.  When she told us, my love for her never changed.  When I asked her why she had that fear, she said she knows of several other kids in school who were disowned by their parents or their attitude totally changed towards them after they came out to their parents.  Someone asked me what I truly felt about it and kept pushing.  My answer to them was my choice was to either not accept it and lose a daughter or accept it and not lose my daughter, I am not going to lose my daughter so to me, the choice was easy.  I fully support her and anyone she loves because love is not a choice, it's an emotion.   My question to anyone who supports this, why is a child at 14 years old able to make medical decisions for themselves even if the parent disagrees yet the child can't decide what they want to be called?  Kids need to be able to vent emotions and feelings and if they can't, or are not comfortable, doing that at home they should be able to talk to a teacher or counselor at school and not fear that conversation is going to HAVE to be reported to his/her parents.  We ALL need someone to talk to!! As for the second bullet point, who decides what an associated nick name is?  Kids are called by all different names today, so the parents should have to be told of all of them?  Are the teachers going to have to keep a black book of all the kids nick names in order to report out to the parents?  Who is going to pay for all these books?  More money from the teachers pockets?

Samuel Carlos ,I strongly oppose; putting children at risk,"I strongly oppose this guidance and believe this puts transgender children and their privacy at risk. Numerous studies have shown that if a transgender child finds themself in an unsupportive and oppressive environment, especially with unsupportive family members and guardians, then they are more likely to take their own lives. Forcing school faculty to expose their students to their parents will ultimately lead to greater harm to the child. On top of that, allowing teachers to single out transgender children by not acknowledging their identity/identifiers will set the precedent that those children are not deserving of the same respect that their cisgender peers are given. This will also lead to greater emotional harm to the child. With these risks, if the child does not want to face the possibility of abuse from their mentors, peers, or guardians, then they would have to remain silent about their identity, which will still cause severe emotional distress. All children deserve the right to have their identity respected and to have their privacy protected if they are at risk of abuse from their parents or guardians.",137219,9/26/22  5:16pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137219

If a student was in a gay relationship and didnt want to tell their parents that should be respected. If a student socially transitions and doesn't want to tell their parents that should also be protected. The erosion of privacy in out country is abhorrent, and the government of our commonwealth should not work to erode those rights even further.

Vincent ,A truly unethical policy that will result in thousands of young deaths.,"To deny individual children the right to self identification and expression of their gender identity is a denial of their agency as human beings. It is neither the school boards place, nor the parents, to speak for a child's bodily autonomy. It is an individual right, and an individual right only. Who but the individual in question could possibly understand and interpret their own perception of them selves and the world. This law is a blatant attempt to cause harm to those who are gender nonconforming. The threat of exposure only ever serves to foster a culture of duplicity and subversion. One where individual will be forced to perpetuate harm and abuse in order to save themselves from it. Those who refuse to do so will be targeted, the revelation of there old identities providing all the incentive bullies and bigots need. Passing this law would result in the deaths of thousands if children from abuse and self harm, if history is any judge of our tendencies as a society.

Anonymous ,A message to the Virginia School Board: Even science disagrees with you.,"It is so upsetting to see that instead of issuing stricter regulations on guns and drugs VA schools have chosen to regulate peoples bodies. This is due to the fact that the school board is trying to eliminate the only safe space that trans people have. We all know it’s because the extremist right is attempting to dispose of people who “think they are the opposite gender.” Some might also argue that this decision was made because the school board is try to prevent sexual interactions. In the past, heterosexual couples would have intercourse in the bathroom no matter what the rules were. There is no avoiding that. Another point that conservative individuals like to bring up, is the fact that trans people do not exist. They simply are, “mentally ill.” According to Jiska Ristori and Thomas D Steensma of the International Review of Psychiatry, “Gender dysphoria (GD) in childhood is a complex phenomenon characterized by clinically significant distress due to the incongruence between assigned gender at birth and experienced gender.” Notice how there is nothing that mentions mental illness. Even if it was just a phase, there are ways that people can de-transition. The same way a woman can increase her cup size from a B-cup to DD-cup, a person can choose to inject testosterone shots that can increase/decrease the levels of testosterone a person has and be the gender/sex that they say they are. The woman with the DD-cup has DD-cups. A person with/without testosterone is who they say they are. Your perception does not indicate who they are. Conservatives like to argue that people who transition might regret it later on in life. Psychologists with the American Psychiatric Association concluded that, “Among individuals with gender incongruence, just more than 70% had received hormone treatment and nearly half (48%) had undergone gender-affirming surgical treatment during the 10-year follow-up period. Nearly all (97%) of those who had undergone surgery also received hormone treatment. Less than one-third had received neither treatment.” That means that less than 3% of people who have transitioned have even bothered to transition back. This means that there are more people that don’t even care about it themselves than people who are trying to enforce this rule. Why is the school board trying to limit the 97% over the 3%. Maybe instead of looking at kids to examine what their genitalia they have, you should try and lower suicide rates and school shooting rates. That should be priority over, “where will this person ?” If there is anyone that took the time to read over my input to this debate, no matter what side of the political compass you’re on, I’d like to thank you for taking time out of your day to read my message. Thank you for your consideration. ~Kenny",137277,9/26/22  5:20pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137277

"Cindy Younghouse, Parent to students in public schools ",A Model for Harm,"Hello. Thank you for this opportunity to contest the harmful and likely illegal 2022 Model Policy.  This model ignores Federal and VA anti- discrimination laws. Additionally, this model permits promotion of disrespect by allowing students and staff to ignore preferred pronouns. Appendix 1, D. 6. This violates the Establishment clause - separation of church and state - when disrespecting preferred pronouns is religion-based in a public school. Then, the definition of transgender student violates family and personal privacy law when they are compelled to make a written request to the school for any validation of their choice of pronouns or gender. You define “sex” but leave out the scientific definition of gender. The Biblical definition of gender is inappropriate in public schools. Leaving out the definition of gender also essentially erases non binary existence, with potential for tragic collateral harm.  Lack of respect and affirmation of gender in pronouns and facilities is damaging; there are studies confirming. Trevor Project. Also see American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) statements on gender affirming care and the medical definitions you lack. This model policy falls short of acceptance and promoting a safe environment for all staff and students, especially the vulnerable gender non conforming. ",137314,9/26/22  5:22pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137314

Samuel J. Martland ,This document is a lousy idea.,"Why are you going to all this trouble to hurt trans kids?  What threat to they pose to you?  How do you justify forcing schools to take the ideological position that trans people don't exist and that we can just deny that they are here? Who is harmed by calling a kid he instead of she, or they instead of either?  Where is the infringement of free speech rights or religious freedom in having a requirement of the job be ""call the kids what they want to be called""?  Teachers are agents of the state; students aren't.  It seems to be that this guidance allows teachers, the agents of the state, to impose their religious and ideological view (trans kids don't exist, or are bad) on regular citizens (the kids).  Anyway, teachers usually call a lot of kids shorter versions of their name, use initials, use a middle name instead of a first name if asked, so you can't claim that it's somehow necessary to call kids only by their legal names.  If a teacher claimed their religion meant that they couldn't say the name Muhammad, or Jesus, or some other religiously-affiliated name, would you tell them they didn't have to?  If a teacher claimed their religion banned girls from playing sports, would you allow them to speak out against girls' sports teams in class?   ",137327,9/26/22  5:23pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137327

Rachel Potter ,I oppose this; it is harmful to youth,"I am a licensed teacher, administrator, and I hold a Virginia Superintendent license. I am also a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, licensed by the Va Board of Medicine to practice in that field. I have served as a teacher educator at the university level and currently am a professor of ABA. These proposed changes are indisputably harmful to youth and put educators in a tremendous ethical bind as it asks our educators to go against their core values of inclusivity and belonging. I strongly oppose these changes in the interest of the safety of trans and queer youth and I implore our legislators to direct efforts and policies toward dignity and inclusion, not harm and bigotry. Educators (and by extension the legislators, boards,  and departments  that develop regulations and policies) have an absolute obligation to ensure the safety of our young people. When the purpose of policy is to place others at risk or to promote unkindness, my heart aches for the impacted youth, their families, and other students who should be seeing models of kindness and compassion. ",137359,9/26/22  5:24pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137359

Jill W ,I support upholding the Constitution and our freedoms—the Gov’t does not own our children!,"Parents absolutely have a right to exercise their fundamental rights, which are granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children. Parents should have the right and freedom to determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering parents is not only a fundamental right, but ensures the government does not overstep and try to take ownership of children, which it has no business doing. Constitutional protections prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological belief. Teachers should not be required to go against their professional-based and/or their faith-based beliefs. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or religious beliefs. Parents are and should be the main decision-makers in their own children’s lives. Constitutionally and ethically, the government does not own our children. Therefore, the act of a school system in promoting/carrying out the secrecy and hiding of decisions and information about a child from his/ her own parent should be considered an unlawful and criminal act. Our country’s constitution protects its citizens from government and government entities that remove freedoms and/or overstep its boundaries. As a parent and teacher, I understand that parents are the most important decision-makers in their children’s lives, and their rights as such should be protected. In no way am I supportive of hiding and obscuring important and/or life-altering information about a child from his/her parent, and I should not be required in a school, as a professional, to take the God-given and constitutional rights away from a parent in any secretive process.",137360,9/26/22  5:24pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137360

Isabella Williams ,Fully oppose,"This policy is not only an egregious violation of privacy, self-expression, and free speech, but it will legally mandate the exposure of trans youth--a vulnerable group already disproportionately subject to violence and abuse, particularly from unaccepting parents--to even greater risk of violence, abuse, disownment, forced conversion therapy, homelessness, self harm and suicide. Forcing children and teenagers to choose between being outed and having their family and living situation potentially destabilized versus being forced to stay in the closet in public will harm every trans youth living under these restrictions and will very likely kill some of them. With respect to the full ban on trans people from using the appropriate bathrooms in which they feel they would be most comfortable and safe from the transphobic violence so prevalent in public restrooms, to bar any group from access to restroom facilities is to restrict them from existing in public in any form for any extended period of time, and it is especially cruel to levy against young people legally required to be in school for seven hours out of the day. It is clear that this policy has been made not for anyone's safety or benefit, but to force transgender people out of society and the public eye, into the closet and into the margins where they will be most exposed to continued violence.

Anonymous ,This hurts education in VA,"I've taught for 8 years, I've trained with some of the best educators in the country and I've worked on my college's committee for best practices. So I can't confidently say there isn't a crumb of good practices in this guidance. Alienating students in the classroom gets in the way of making the learning experience relevant to them, which is a major key to helping students reach their full potential. On top of that, as mounds of research show, our trans neighbors, family and friends see dramatic rises in dangerous, very often fatal mental illness when they face hardships. They see a huge reduction in those dangers when even small steps are made to respect them and their identities. This isn't just about learning, it's about keeping young people alive. Anyone with a heart knows anti-trans policies have no place in a Virginia where we act with kindness to each other. Let's focus on lifting up students, not singling them out and tearing them down.

"Keep Prisons Single Sex, USA ",We support 2022 Model Policies providing single-sex spaces for students,"Keep Prisons Single Sex is an organization dedicated to maintaining single-sex prisons and jails. The motivation for such a mission is the safety, privacy and dignity of incarcerated women and girls, all of which are jeopardized in mixed-sex facilities. These same concerns apply in a school setting. All of Virginia’s students are entitled to privacy with the use of single-sex facilities in spaces such as locker rooms, restrooms, and sleeping quarters when all school trips. Further, for the safety of your female students, such single-sex facilities must be strictly enforced. Where mixed-sex facilities for school children have been permitted, there have been sexual assaults, children unwilling to use the facilities, and enormous embarrassment with conducting private bodily functions in front of the opposite sex. Single-sex facilities are required to ensure full access to education by your female students. Female students who are religiously observant and practice modesty are likely to have full access to their education limited by mixed-sex facilities and sports. Students who have had children and use facilities to nurse or pump will be reluctant to attend school if they are not guaranteed a single-sex space. When girls begin menstruating, it is often irregular and unpredictable leading to the need for access to sinks to wash out clothing. Same for your students who use menstrual cups and need access to a sink to rinse them. For girls using other sanitary products, even the noises of opening the packages can be mortifying if others are around to hear. Girls embarrassed to urinate in front of boys may avoid using the restroom all day (resulting in bladder infections or dehydration by limiting fluid intake) or may be reluctant to attend school. That some students claim a “gender identity” different than their sex, does not speak to any change in sex as sex is immutable and cannot be changed. It is sexed bodies – not identities – which use bathrooms and locker rooms and play sports. As the 2022 Model Policies document correctly points to: students are entitled to protection under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act on the basis of their sex. They are entitled to single-sex spaces. For these, and other, reasons, we support implementation of the 2022 Model Policies. Thank you for the opportunity to make this submission. -Keep Prisons Single Sex, USA",137419,9/26/22  5:27pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137419

Anonymous ,Panders to voters; does not protect students.,"In an ideal situation, parents will love and support their children unconditionally. Many children do not have this experience. Does VA have a number in mind? How many children and teens must be homeless, how many children and teens must attempt suicide before we trust that children know their own families better than the Department of Education does? Even when parents request that children be called by their preferred name, this policy (if I understand it correctly) still gives teachers the ability to ignore the parents' wishes if they think God has a problem with it. (God does not want you to hurt children, so the idea that teachers can use God's name to cause injury to anyone is against the third of the 10 commandments - do not use God's name in vain.)  Our world is hard enough. Whatever we can do to make all of our kids safe and happy at school, and able to learn instead of being anxious about being accepted, is what we need to do.

That is exasperated by being a teenager and now people trying to tell you that you aren't who you are! We already have a high suicide rate for teenagers in this country, add to that the suicide rate for transgender teens and you can see why what you are doing will have a devastating effect on these kids. This is nothing more than a political ploy to attack someone who can't fight back.

Some students agreed to this but others  were afraid of abuse and possibly even being homeless. Not every student lives in a reasonable loving home.

Children do not hide being trans from their parents just for fun. They do it out of fear. Many children know that if their  parents find out the are trans, they’ll be abused, kicked out of the house, or worse. Where will these children go if their school is required to report their gender identity to parents? If students have parents they cannot trust, shouldn’t they be able to put trust in the other adults in their life, teachers?

Adam Stuart Korengold ,LGBTQ people cannot be denied fundamental rights because your worldview refuses to see them.,"I am writing in regard to the ""Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students"" guidance issued by the Governor of Virginia. I am a citizen of Virginia and of the United States. My daughter is also a citizen of Virginia and of the United States, and is LGBTQ. I am disgusted that your policy guidance fundamentally ignores the basic agency and fundamental rights of Virginia students to define their gender identity. Transgender students are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, and to commit suicide, than cisgender students. Your refusal to recognize the basic human rights of transgender people, and to enact policies that will result in violence against them, is not the least bit surprising because you use the same political and legal arguments to justify the denial of basic human rights and bodily agency to women. It is government's job to protect the lives of ALL PEOPLE, regardless of whether their worldview conflicts with yours, and of whether their personhood conflicts with your worldview. Enacting these model policies will endanger transgender students, not protect them.",137481,9/26/22  5:31pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137481

Anonymous ,I apose the bill it upsets not only trans but also the queer community ,"I do not support this because why would they try and make trans do something they do not want to do its like there forcing something on themselves. Like would you like to be treated badly or would you like someone to make you feel like you cant be want you would like to be because that's probably how they feel. And you probably would not like that at all and i understand parents don't like the idea of having a Queer teacher or having anything to do with queer stuff but they are going to have to understand that they cant not control everything. And i understand they would like to focus on the parents and make sure that they are happy but what about everybody else your hurting, what about the trans people who probably already have to deal with during the daily bases why would you wanna hurt them even more by making them feel like they shouldn't be who they wanna be like let them be free and i feel as tho your only focusing on one person point of view or there bad review but they are going to have to understand that everything is not about that bad review or that once person negative comment the should focus on the ones that are being hurt",137485,9/26/22  5:31pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137485

"A Queer, Trans Alum of Virginia's Public Schools ",This is dangerous.,"When Virginia became the first in the south to pass comprehensive protections for its LGBTQ residents, I was so proud to be a lifelong resident of this Commonwealth. I felt immeasurably safer--and yet now, with this, I am ashamed.  You have plenty of studies and data available that shows these kinds of policies don't ""cure"" people of their transness or protect youth, but hurt them instead. You and I both know that this ""protection"" argument is in bad faith and that the real goal here is to remove the sight of trans people from public space.  What I want to say, though, is my experience as a kindergarten through bachelor's degree product of Virginia public schools as a queer, trans person.  I am from Lynchburg, an alum of EC Glass. While I was a student there, Jerry Falwell was still alive, and the issue of the time wasn't trans people, but just queer people in general. It felt like every other week there was a letter to the editor in the News and Advance talking about how ""the gays"" were going to hell. One of my English teachers made a point when assigning us argumentative essays that she didn't want to read about gay marriage. We were omitted from health class and from reading lists. An attempt to start a Gay-Straight Alliance sputtered and failed. And in a school of 1600 kids over four years, there were only ever 3 people who were out while attending there. Once we graduated and went beyond the shadow of Thomas Road Baptist Church, there was an explosion of us coming out. Countless. The unspoken rule of pretending queerness didn't exist did not stop us from being queer. It only made us hide out of fear.  I had a bad home life. School was one of the safer environments for me. There are kids now where this is also the case, especially trans kids who cannot safely come out to their parents. Enacting these measures will take that safe environment away from them. Trans kids are going to be trans no matter what pronouns or name or bathroom you make them use. You cannot stop them being trans, but you can respect them. You can treat them like the human beings that they are. You can choose to be part of the solution that ensures they make it to adulthood instead of an early self-inflicted grave. This policy, if enacted, will have blood on its hands--and by extension, so will you.",137516,9/26/22  5:33pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137516

Michael Ginsberg ,Strongly support the new policies,"I strongly support the new policies.  As a parent, I want to know if my child is struggling with gender issues or any other psychological or sexual issues.  If a public school -- funded with my tax dollars -- knows about my child having these issues, I want the school to tell me.  Period, full stop.  There is no excuse for adults providing major sexual or psychological counseling to my child without my knowing.  I cannot believe anyone would oppose this -- it is such a common-sense policy it defies reason to think a parent wouldn't want to know this about their child or would be comfortable with a school keeping this information from them.  I'd wager a lot of the people advocating for this policy don't have children or have an ideological axe to grind.  Regardless, I insist on schools keeping me apprised of my children's development and of any issues they may be encountering.  This new policy assures Virginia's public schools will.",137520,9/26/22  5:33pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137520

As a Christian, it is not my place to judge but to love and accept all my students as they are, not as some self-righteous, short-sighted person says they should be. (Yes, I'm judging here, and I forgive them for those traits).  As a mother who lost her son after 12 years of battling with severe depression, I can tell you that there is nothing worse than waking up every day knowing your child has died. I will NEVER make a child's gender, pronoun usage, or desired name an issue for any child, and nor will they be unwelcome in my class. I will not follow this proposed policy if - heaven forbid - it should come to pass.

Anonymous ,I oppose these policies,"This proposal clearly takes the stance that adults know their child better than the child knows themself. It strips away a student’s autonomy and ability to articulate who they are and to be treated as a person with an identity, thoughts, and emotions. This proposal disregards the safety and well-being of the students it claims to protect. If put into effect, would make schools unsafe environments for transgender and nonbinary students to exist, and would likely lead to further discrimination than that which is already present in today’s society about the existence of transgender and nonbinary people and our right to exist without fear of being erased.  Another point worth mentioning is that this proposal specifically addresses social transitions, which usually consist of a person asking to be referred by different pronouns than they were previously, a possible name change, and potentially a change in clothing style. None of these changes are permanent or harmful. ",137528,9/26/22  5:33pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137528

Marcia Carpentier ,It is outrageous to fight culture wars on the backs of LGBTQ students,"I would like to express my outrage at yet another attempt by Republicans to fight their culture wars on the backs of minorities who cannot defend themselves.  In this case, the offense is particularly bad because it involves children.Increasing social acceptance of LGBTQ people is one of the most positive social changes this country has experienced in recent years.  The benefits are obvious and everywhere, and there's no downside that I can see.  Nobody is worse off, any more than right-handed kids are worse off when left-handed kids get to write the way they want to and aren't abused for it.  And nevertheless there's a backlash, one that's been manipulated in an extremely cynical way by people who are going to end up inflicting a great deal of pain.  On children.Part of that manipulation involves creating a whole ""ideology"" to attack the non-abuse of LGBTQ people.  There's no ideology involved... it's all about treating people decently versus being a bully.  The sort of parents who claim their opposition to LGBTQ acceptance is some grand ideological position are the biggest bullies of all, which goes to show why LGBTQ kids are overrepresented among homeless youth.  Allowing other adults to counsel students on matters of sexual orientation and gender identity, within appropriate professional boundaries of course, is most important to those students who won't get a positive reaction at home.  And I believe that cutting off that kind of access, thus making the parents gatekeepers to any kind of assistance a kid might need, is a form of cruelty that we do not need in Virginia.",137562,9/26/22  5:35pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137562

David Dooley ,Oppose Changing Virginia's Education Policies,"As a father, veteran, and grandfather of children raised here in Prince William County, Virginia I vehemently oppose the changes proposed in this document.  My trans-nephew came out to his mother, uncles, and I a little over two years ago with our total support both at home and at school. There is absolutely no justification in changing the existing rules allowing him to use the bathroom of his choice, to have the staff use his pronouns, and out him if he was closeted.  I thought we are to love each other because ""Love is the greatest gift of God.""  How is anything in these proposed changes done in love? Additionally, it is absolutely ridiculous to state you are trying to have a safe environment for all students.  THERE have been ZERO cases of a transgender person assaulting any ever in Virginia.  HOWEVER, there have been documented cases over and over again of cisgender heterosexual men (and some women) who prey on youth.  THIS will do nothing to stop that.

Anonymous ,I strongly oppose this hateful policy,"This is hatred and pandering thinly veiled as parental rights. It is absurd that the words privacy, dignity, and respect are used to describe this policy, as it engenders the opposite. Not all students feel safe talking to parents about gender out sexual identity.  As a mental health professional, I am keenly aware of the importance of children and adolescents having safe spaces to be themselves and work through things they aren't yet able it ready to share with others. This policy places already vulnerable students, especially those who have been living for some time as their identified gender, at risk for harm and humiliation. How is this a protection of their rights or a demonstration of dignity? How is it a demonstration of respect and dignity to place school staff who are supportive of transgender and/or gender fluid students in a position where they may get in trouble for actually demonstrating respect for a student by using chosen names or pronouns? How about gender neutral bathrooms on all schools? How about support tor parents in understanding and talking about these difficult topics with their children in a supportive manner? How about recognizing that a religious belief does not magically change someone's gender or sexual identity? And that a child or adolescent's beliefs may differ from those of a parent?  And a legal document being necessary to comply with name/pronoun changes, really? Why is this necessary, especially if parents are aware and agree?  The next time you want to introduce a policy that proclaims to promote respect, privacy, and dignity, please make sure your are using those words accurately. ",137598,9/26/22  5:37pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137598

I would like the students who have identified as boys the entire time they have been at our secondary school to continue to be in the BOYS locker room - not to suddenly be forced into the girls locker room with my daughter - regardless of what their gender was at birth.

Maddie Johnson ,This is incredibly dangerous.,"My name is Maddie Johnson and I am a non-binary college student. I have seen up close how dangerous policies like this can be. Referring to a transgender person by their correct name and pronouns is, when it comes down to it, suicide prevention. Having a label forced upon you that does not align with how you view yourself is absolutely devastating, and can, has, and WILL cause students extreme suffering.  People shy away from LGBT issues, claiming that trans children have been indoctrinated, or that talking about sexuality to a child is inherently sexual and should not even be breeches. To those people I ask: where exactly do you believe trans and queer adults come from? They were all once children as well, and many of them were children that felt incredibly out of place, ostracized, and depressed, because they thought that who they were was wrong or abnormal. I think the sheer abuse written into this bill is in its exact claim. Why are we protecting parents over children? If it’s between an adult feeling uncomfortable that their perception of someone is incorrect and a child feeling depressed, out of place, and possibly suicidal, I will always side with the child. These things are all real. These are things that both I myself and most trans individuals I know have experienced. Finally, I must ask, is this really a parents’ rights issue? Because it was, there would be a requirement that a child be addressed by their preferred name and pronouns if they prefer it. They should be allowed to prevent any discussion of their child’s sexuality, suspected or otherwise, for the sake of privacy.  In conclusion, this bill values grown adults comfort over children’s safety, and I am extremely terrified of what will happen to the future of transgender people in Virginia if this bill is passed.",137603,9/26/22  5:37pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137603

Micah ,Strongly and firmly opposed,"The goal of the state when creating legislation regarding schools should only ever be fostering success in both the academics of students and the school system itself. This proposed legislation is entirely opposite of this goal and will only harm trans students throughout the state of Virginia. As a transgender senior in Texas, my years in high school have been marked by completely avoiding the consumption of any liquid before and throughout the school day to avoid using the restroom at school, never speaking in class to teachers or classmates because legislation allows them to never use my name if they so please and never refer to me correctly. It is extremely difficult to excel in school when you can’t pee, when you can’t speak, and when everyone refers to you as if you were an entirely different person. This year has been the only year in my entire life where I was finally able to at least use the nurses office for the restroom and use a different name and pronouns in class. And yes, some teachers do not like that and don’t use my pronouns and avoid referring to me at all. No one, absolutely no one, is forcing such teachers to go against “their values” or “their religion” or whatever the republican legislators believe. If you don’t want to support us, good for you.

Jayne Cobern ,"Sets kids up for bullying, depression and suicide","Schools should be safe places physically and emotionally. Youth are learning who they are and wrestling with their own identities. They need the support of educators at this very challenging time. This is especially true of our transgender and queer youth, who are facing the choice to live their truth or to hide who they are to please those outside of themselves. The proposed changes to the way schools interact with transgender and queer youth is a huge step backwards in recognizing and supporting our diverse student  body in Virginia. We know that queer and transgender youth have higher rates of depression, suicide and bullying than straight cisgender youth. Parents are not always supporting initially or know how to respond when their child comes out to them. Someone at school may be the only person a child feels safe sharing emotional turmoil with. Forcing staff to tell parents what a student may not be ready to share about their identity is unconscionable.  Forcing students to use a bathroom of their biological sex or to use a name that they do not identify with is cruel.

Misty Riddle ,I fully OPPOSE this policy,"This policy will directly impact my child and thousands more like him. I honestly do not feel that anyone would have thought this new policy was a good idea if they had bothered doing even a modicum of research. Trans and non binary teens are at an increased risk of suicide and attempted suicide. Why? Because they are not being supported at home and they are not being supported at school. Creating policies that require kids to be outed to their families if they want support at school (support that can be denied based on ""personal"" or ""religious"" beliefs under this policy), forcing them to be called by a name they do not identify with, and forcing them to use or put up with being referred to by pronouns they do not identify with is damaging. This does not give them the ""respect that all students deserve"". This does not give them the ""dignity that all students deserve"".  This policy is dangerous. This policy will open an already at risk, marginalized community up to more hate, more discrimination, more bullying, more abuse, more violence and more suicide deaths than they already face every single day just because they dare to exist.  You cannot say that you care about all kids while attempting to pass policies that are guaranteed to physically and mentally harm certain groups, in order to appease the political powers that be.  These are living breathing people Glenn Youngkin, his base, and the Department of Education are playing with. Human beings are not political chess pieces and every one of you should be ashamed for using them as such. ",137632,9/26/22  5:38pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137632

Rachael Belliveau ,Strongly Opposed ,"Autonomy over one's body is a natural right. By taking away a person's right to decide who they share their truth with and when, you are violating that right, plain and simple. When someone else makes such a deeply personal decision for a child, it opens them up to violence and abuse. It teaches them that their bodies aren't theirs anymore. What you are proposing is not only physically dangerous, but psychologically damaging. Queer, Trans, non-bianary, gender fluid, gender-nonconforming and all that is in between have existed since the beginning of humanity. It is time to stop ignoring that fact and hold a safe space for ALL of our children.

Anonymous ,Policy of Hate,"Glenn Youngkin and the rest of the GOP have ripped off their masks (not that they ever wore them anyway) and are showing everyone paying attention exactly who they are--hateful bigots who want to play with the lives of children to further their culture war.  I am a transgender woman, and when I was in school I absolutely hated myself and was also absolutely terrified of what my life would be if I ever came out. As an adult I've since come to terms with myself and am working on living my life but my heart breaks knowing what trans kids are going through now with this sort of spotlight on them constantly.  It is basic human decency to refer to someone by the pronouns that they have told you they go back. It is basic human decency to refer to someone by the name that they have told you is their name. It is a gross and dangerous act to out a child to their family who may not be supportive. School may be the only part of their life where they get to live THEIR LIFE. If you're a parent and you're concerned that your child may be queer but hasn't come out to you yet--ask yourself why you have that fear. Ask yourself what you've said about LGBT people around your child. Ask yourself how you've treated your child.   Trans kids are an already vulnerable population to suicide because of how society by and large treats them. If you support this then you support the mental anguish, fear, and anxiety that trans kids will endure. You support the emboldening of bigotry in their lives. You support directly harming others just because they don't meet your heteronormative society. You have bought lies that were sold to you at best, and at worst you're just a scummy human being with disregard for the lives of others.  It's sickening to know that we share the same state. ",137660,9/26/22  5:40pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137660

According to the Human Rights Campaign, ”LGBTQ youth are at particular risk, with recent data showing that 29% of transgender youth, 21% of gay and lesbian youth and 22% of bisexual youth have attempted suicide.” As someone who has attempted suicide, I can say that rolling back the rights of transgender people will almost definitely impact the amount of people attempting suicide.

If I had during my youth been forcibly outed and publicly shamed by none less than the governor of my state, as you now propose to do to Virginian trans kids, I genuinely would have killed myself. That is not an exaggeration I mean that sincerely. To think that you Governor Younkin, a grown man, is using the weight of law to bully children you don't like TO DEATH, is horrifying and vile.

Martin Fisher ,"False, fake Frankengenders harm kids and in free society no one is obligated to play along.","We must not lie to children. These false, fake Frankengenders stitched together in the labs of leftist political science put children at risk as pawns in a national campaign against humanity and the corruption of family values. Remembering that in free society, no one is obligated to play along with the delusional charades of sexually disoriented people, we see clearly how governments, and especially the schools, must not ever favor, let alone promote, gender based ideological orthodoxy. These gender based belief systems are the exact equal to anything religious and have no supported scientific principle to them beyond the application of the orthodox beliefs themselves. At some point, this Transgenderism charade, the taunting for Frankengender lies, will meet its unsustainable end and many kids taken by them will be utterly ruined of everything that they thought and were led to believe could create this false, fake fraud of a reality: games over. This emotional pandering has no basis in biology as human beings with the sexual reproductive system of males, or the mutilated remains thereof, shall never ever be female: they will never have a cycle, ovaries, fallopian tubes, a uterus, cervix or vagina, or produce female sexual gametes, no matter how skilled the surgical switch from a crotch rocket to a crotch pocket may be, how much hormone blocking and boosting is done, however thick the mascara and absolutely FABULOUS the outfits — nope!

It may endanger the health, safety, and wellbeing to communicate any real or perceived sexual behaviors or gendered traits. Additionally, the whole of the Virginia education system is stretched too thin to utilize teachers, staff and administrators work hours focused on “outing” students to their parents. Legislators time and effort would be better spent, rather than rewriting transgender student guidance, to reallocate funds toward teachers’ and staff salaries.  The changes made to this document give undue power to anti-transgender school system employees.

Cassidy Crockett-Verba ,These Model Policies are Disrespectful,"Although the model policies claim to respect all students, they do not come close. Their model policies create an environment of bullying, disrespect, and outright endangerment of kids who just want to live their lives. The model policies include a provision that takes the resources a school has into account (without requiring school divisions to even attempt to properly resource their schools) including taking into account ""the rights and needs of other students and of school staff.""  The rights of transgender kids to be included as any other student does not infringe on the rights of any other student or staff. This is simply an attempt to other and exclude trans kids. The model policies put forward by this administration uphold the idea that parents are the ultimate authority on children both at home and at school, without exception. This is not true, no matter how many cases they cite. If this were true, Virginia would not have standards for homeschooling children (§ 22.1-254.1), banned conversion therapy for those under 18 (§ 54.1-2409.5), nor vaccination requirements for school. All of these show that while yes, courts in Troxel and Wisconsin v. Yoder found that parents have a right to parent how they see fit, there are limitations on that right. This right is far from absolute. If a parent wants to teach their kid how they see fit, they should homeschool their child. A small subset of parents should not be able to make schools a hostile environment for trans kids.  I have no doubt that this administration has seen the rates of suicide in trans youth, specifically the disparity between trans youth that is supported by those around them and trans youth that is not supported. At this point I, like many others, believe this administration does not care about the trans kids that will die as a result of their policies. Their policies will directly increase the amount of Trans kids who are outed in unsafe environments, kids who are subjected to bullying from peers and bullying by those who are supposed to educate and support them. I have lived in Virginia my entire life and I know that we are better than this. We must be better than this. Our state motto is ""Virginia is for Lovers"" but these policies are not exemplifying that idea at all. We aren't a state for some, we are a state for all, built on love and pride. I hope the administration takes this to heart and modifies these policies with this comment and all of the opposition in mind.",137744,9/26/22  5:44pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137744

Maya Mahdi ,"Unfair, unjust, and inhuman policy. ","Personal or majoritarian beliefs have no place in public school policy. All students should be treated equally, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. To single out LGBTQ students is to tell the world that these lives matter less than others. Children - whether 6 or 16 - have autonomy. They should be able to choose which bathroom to use based on their comfort and which team to play on based on their identity. No one other than themselves can tell them who they should be or how they should act or which bathroom they should use. While most parents may have their child’s best interest at heart, this policy puts those children whose parents are not understanding and potentially violent against their children at physical, mental, and emotional risk. Treat children as the owners of their own bodies. Being a part of the LGBTQ community poses no threat to the safety or well-being of the students - unless this policy is enacted. Essentially, this policy is demeriting students based on their sexual orientation and identity. It is inhumane and it poses a threat to our society because not all students will have an equal and positive educational experience.

Dane Lauritzen ,"Strongly opposed - This will harm, perhaps even lead to deaths, of Trans kids","I strongly oppose the changes to the Model Policies for Treatment of Transgender Students. Vulnerable and innocent LGBT+ students experience high rates of bullying, child abuse, depression, and suicide due to bigotry and intolerance. This proposal would create a hostile and potentially dangerous school environment for our VA transgender and nonbinary youth, requiring teachers and staff to forcibly “out” students, prohibit staff from supporting trans and nonbinary students such as using a students affirming name and pronouns, and prohibit access or participation in activities consistent with their gender identity.  This policy change ignores medical science related to gender-affirming care, disregards the history of bigotry against transgender students, and endangers the very youth and families that it claims to protect. It ignores the high rates of depression and suicide in transgender youth that is directly related to the stigma and bigotry that these vulnerable and powerless individuals face in school, at church, and in our general society. In fact, the Governor's policy reinforces bigotry, intolerance, and false ""grooming"" narratives that smear the very existence of trans and nonbinary individuals.",137764,9/26/22  5:45pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137764

Josh Greenfield ,Strongly opposed,"The basic principles of both sets of guidelines are just: one to prevent bullying and provide support to children who are much more at risk of being target of it, the other maintaining that parents should have a say in their children’s education; however, I believe the proper balance of these principles should be made through research as well as education of parents in addition to children. We are only just starting to understand transgender issues, but it is by no means a US-specific phenomenon, nor is it a new one. Classics researchers have found that even as far back as the golden period of Ancient Greek civilization, men were disassociating with their sex. In response to our new understanding, I propose that more time and money be spent on research into how this phenomenon affects other children around them, the reasons for this disassociation, research into how proposed guidelines taking away protections for vulnerable demographics like transgender children might make things much worse for them, etc., so that whatever the response is, it is based on statistically significant evidence to show it is the right course of action for all. In addition, efforts can be made to show that all of us can exist together without making the claim that the existence of some individuals encroaches upon the rights of others. Those protections should go both ways: all of us are human, and should have the right to go through life with the same dignity and comforts given to our fellow US citizens.",137768,9/26/22  5:45pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137768

Amy Huml ,Strongly Oppose Governor's Model Which Puts Vulnerable Youth at Risk of Harm,LGBTQIA+ youth are 4 times more likely to attempt suicide not because of their gender identity or orientation but because of how they are treated.  Parents need to be educated and supported in understanding what their children/youth are experiencing so they can support them.  Children are experiencing mental health crises at unprecedented levels and the Governor instead wants to focus on ways that will cause more damage both to children/youth that are more vulnerable and to an already overburdened and underappreciated public education system.  Your regressive and cruel policies won't stop youth from living their true sexual orientation and gender identities but suicide will stop them from living.  Is that the legacy you want?,137774,9/26/22  5:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137774
Despina M Belle-Isle ,Strongly oppose the Anti-transgender policy,"This anti-transgender policy is nothing more than discrimination against kids who the governor wants to silence. This is not in the best interest of children and families. Rather it is the opposite of best interests. It is shameful and harmful and frankly, disgusting.  Denying kids the right to be addressed in the manner that they request is harmful to kids and sends the message that they should be ashamed of who they are.  Refusing kids the right to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity is harmful to their mental health and could put them in physical danger.  The majority of Virginians oppose this plan. The fact that Youngkin was elected is immaterial to the imposition of this policy. The majority of voters who voted for him did not expect him to enact these kinds of radical right wing policies. People who voted for him bought the message that he was a moderate, which we know now is entirely untrue.  This policy is NOT the law. It is a policy that a right wing appointee of the governor has drafted and is now implementing because the law allows the department of education to implement policies. But the policy that existed under the Northam administration was the appropriate policy that represented and supported the best interests of children and families.  It is infuriating that this right wing administration is bringing us back to the 1950's when the LGBTQ+ community was forced to stay in the closet. The hatred that this administration is showing to our children is repugnant. ",137776,9/26/22  5:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137776

Edna Gorman ,Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools I approve.,"What is the most insidious crime for women & what crimes do most women fear from a very young age?  Rape & sexual assault.  It changes your young life forever.  It changes your views of men in general, even if they are very good  fathers, very good brothers,  very good boyfriends etc.  Many women never speak about the incident to even their closest friends, but the fear remains forever.  Even women who have not been raped or sexually assaulted still know it can happen to them and avoid area & places that they know are dangerous.  Most women at one time in their young lives as well as the rest of their lives have been approached by males in the school who wish to do them sexual harm. When I was in school, the bathroom was the sanctuary for women.  We could fairly be sure that once we entered the girls bathroom, we could lock the door & stop the person pursuing us.  I have a friend whose granddaughter was just assaulted in her school in California.  When her father went to the school administrator, they said ""at least she was not killed.""  I understand that children can be very cruel to other children.  They can bully children about almost anything, color of their hair, color of their shoes, a silly statement they made in class, etc. etc. etc..  We all know poor children or small children who are bullied by those children who are not understanding of their economic situation or have not been taught by their parents to be kind., but the answer is not giving the bully more time with them, it is working with the parents to solve the bullying problem.  Yes, I said working with the parents.  If the school requires the parents to work with administrators concerning behavior problems then they also know that parents are the key factor in counseling & working with their own children, Parents should & must have all information about their children; have all responsibility for their children's behaviors; & have the knowledge to help their children in every phase of their education & lives.  School programs should primarily be for teaching concrete education, reading, math etc.  not morals.  That is the parents job.  I strongly approve of the new & improved Model  & I thank Governor Youngkin & those who wrote it for their responsible policy.   ",137784,9/26/22  5:46pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137784

The students who will become targets with this horrible policy may be haunted for the rest of their lives. They need love and support not hate and ignorance as they navigate a difficult course through their personal identity.  I WANT THE VDOE TO REJECT THIS POLICY AND NOT LET IT MOVE ANY PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE BACK IN TO THE DARK AGES.

If someone is questioning their gender, they should be required to wait until they are no longer the parent's responsibility. At eighteen you're allowed to make your own choices because you're the one affected by them.

Anonymous ,this policy will cost lives,"transitioning has saved millions of lives. 97% of trans people are satisfied with their transition. many times, transitions involve medical interventions. these also save countless lives a year. depriving children of medicine is cruelty. depriving children of the bare ability to socially transition is murder. this policy will cost lives—childrens’ lives.  fascism is on the rise. fascists hate trans people. fascists have been putting forth policies like these to intentionally end trans lives. by supporting this code, you will align yourself with the fascists. history has indicated this is a bad idea.  don’t let fascists abuse you into harming other people. people are struggling right now, due to the ineffectual nature of the US government & capitalists exploiting this for centuries. when somebody deprives you of resources & convinces you it’s it’s ok to harm people, that is abuse. break the cycle of abuse. i have been placed in many unsafe situations because i am trans. i’m midwestern, too, so that was really hard. many important trans people in my life have died by suicide. i started transitioning 5 years ago. the US medical system has made me wait around 11 years to receive a lifesaving surgery. i estimate because i still haven’t got it. i found myself 10 years ago, actually, but couldn’t transition until 5 years later because i lived in the rural christian midwest. a place where the klan runs things. waiting that long under that kind of fear has traumatized me extensively. i got this weird disorder that makes me feel repulsed about my body & my sex organs, so that kinda sucks. i’ve wound up in a psych ward over it. i only got out 2 months ago. i have 3 college degrees & held stable employment in the finance sector before I came out—just random facts. it sounds insane, but the most insane part of all of this? i’m only one trans person. there’s millions of stories like these. over centuries. and they’re not children’s books. if this seems cruel to you, then why would you put anyone through this? why would you put CHILDREN through this?  don’t put children through this. that’s what this law will do, just to be clear. all of us know this. by all of us, I mean “every trans person in the country”.  5% of young adults in the US are trans or nonbinary.  that’s millions of people. the next generation of adults (today’s children) will likely supersede them—as the zoomers have sped right past millennials. millennials were once the gayest generation. i’m a millennial.  to break a cycle of abuse, you must first stop participating in it. decline to participate in abuse. don’t burden yourself with the eventual guilt you will feel over thousands of trans children’s lives being lost to your actions.  strike this down.  it is cruel. it is child abuse. don’t participate in child abuse. thank you. ",137896,9/26/22  5:52pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137896

Anonymous Teacher ,Strongly Oppose - Afraid for my students,"I am so afraid of what this policy will mean for my transgender and non-binary students. I am afraid for the students who have just a few hours each day where they feel free to express themselves or explore gender identity because they know that their parents would be angry, possibly violent, if they were to do so at home. I am afraid for the students who feel suicidal and need support, but will be too afraid to ask for help if it means teachers and counselors are legally obligated to out them to their parents even if they did not feel safe to share that information yet. I am even afraid for my students who have loving and supportive parents who support their gender identity, chosen name, and pronouns. They may be forced to use a bathroom and locker room that triggers their dysphoria - or would have this policy protect any teacher who refuses to use their name and pronouns despite having parent support.

Brandi ,Horrible and Hypocritical,"This is saying that it gives parents choice over what happens in the classrooms but what about the parents who disagree? Not all parents are Christian or religious at all and understand that deadnaming and outing students against their will is extremely damaging. LGBT teenagers are already more likely to commit suicide or be homeless than other teenagers. This is setting up a system of increasing these preventable outcomes. Students need to feel safe at school, and since we refuse to protect them from active shooters, then at least let them be comfortable being themselves at school and getting the support other straight kids receive without teachers, who I'm sure want to help these students (and if they don't, they shouldn't be teaching - if you can't accept different religions and beliefs than yours, you have no business being in public service of any kind, ""Live and let live"" and all that), feeling like their jobs will be threatened. Not sure how any part of being LGBT affects other students, or especially other parents and families as a whole, that this policy is even being considered. I've been in high school in the 2000s. The only people who know about a student being LGBT are the people who the student is comfortable knowing. If that means they're completely out, don't destroy their confidence and well-being by deadnaming them and preventing them from being involved in sports like other students are able to enjoy without issue. For people who boast so hard about Christianity, no one involved in this decision seems to have ever actually read the Bible, nor understands any of the tenants within it. Anyone who votes in favor of this is despicable and should be ashamed of themselves and the legacy they'll leave behind of being completely ridiculous and dragging Virginia back into the dark ages instead of being any part of the present or future who aren't so bothered about witch hunting. That happened in the 1600s and 1700s... Not an event we need to bring back by the people who claim other people disagreeing with Christianity or saying ""Happy Holidays"" instead of ""Merry Christmas"" is a witch hunt against them. Maybe more of them needed to pay attention in school, especially history, instead of being so absorbed in so many other people's lives. Maybe they wouldn't be so ignorant. ",137902,9/26/22  5:52pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137902

Lance Seberhagen ,"Generally support proposed policy, but some changes are needed.","In accord with the proposed policy, parents should have sole responsibility for identifying the name, biological sex, and gender identity of each of their children, as well as to provide birth certificates, if available.  However, parents do not have the right to give their children entrance to restrooms and locker rooms of the opposite biological sex.   Non-trans people have rights, too!  Therefore, school systems should provide these facilities on the basis of biological sex, plus additional facilities as needed to accommodate trans people who prefer not to use the facilities provided for their biological sex. With regard to sports teams, school systems should continue to define sports teams on the basis of biological sex in recognition of inherent physical differences by sex.  Parents should give approval for their children to participate in sports but do not have the right to give their children entrance to sports teams of the opposite biological sex.

Susan ,Put the children in uniforms and stop all of this.," there has been a lot of talk about the rights of the transgender community to be dramatic with regard to their clothing.  But what is not being addressed here is the root cause of this relatively new situation.  those of us adults having grown up in a time where are the sodomy rainbow flag pedophile culture was not present it to the children were they were sexualized. So that was not a part of the culture at the time, and so people were not having struggles with their identity, which has come about from a lack of responsible leadership on the part of this one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  so there has been tremendous harm that has happened to the children throughout this country as a result of these far left-wing sense of liberties and entitlement to show the kids things that they should not be exposed to against the king of kings.  The children are the victims, and there should be a national recovery period of time where all of the children are wearing uniforms under no circumstances should a boy ever go into a girls bathroom and vice versa. It’s extremely important that no child is ever placing that kind of emphasis on something about gender identity, being more important than the core fundamental values that should be held up across the board for safety and security of all of the children.  so there are lots of things that need to be turned around..  And it is the job of the justice department to be helping to guide these core values of what is acceptable for children to be exposed to in these public school systems this sexualized community. when you are presenting to children as early as kindergarten, the rainbow pedophile flag in the classroom, introducing sex things this sex identity flagfor the children. You certainly are going to create a great deal of confusion about who is who for the kids.  School is to be used for education of subject matters.  And all sex things are to be kept away from children. and certainly the children would not even know to have these problems in the first place unless you showed them how to have these problems by disturbing the peace in the first place.   I strongly recommend that you remove all sex related things remotely in the presence of the children.  And the sex flag for the children beginning in kindergarten is one of the root causes of this disturbance to these vulnerable victims..   The children should not be exposed to rainbows except for in the sky or in the artwork and never, was it appropriate to expose them to the rainbow to be used for perverse works.   and by the way on here, it looks like the real comments are coming from real parents, and it looks like the lefties have a bunch of bots with comments that are the exact same thing with nothingness in the comments for the most part.   thank you, Governor of Virginia you are heroic, and taking a very strong stand for the well-being and safety of these children across the board. And of course you never ate ever but a boy go into the girls restroom  that is a safety issue. It’s also disturbing to the girls. yeah, we didn’t have kids confused about whether or not they wanted to be a boy or a girl and that’s because we didn’t have the pedophile culture in the school, sexualizing the children.     ",137942,9/26/22  5:54pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137942

This policy will terrorize and hurt trans kids who already face enormous pressure. But I guess that doesn't matter to Youngkin as much as pleasing his gladhanders who worship at HTC on Sunday and then design bombs at Raytheon on Monday, eh?  Nearly half of all LGBT youth have seriously considered suicide. Youngkin's awful policies would push the trans kids of VA one step closer to the edge. He should step down from office and, by way of reparations, give a fraction of the $$ he's made from corporate adventurism to the minority groups he's targeted.

Camryn F ,Strongly oppose this. Act now to protect trans kids! ,"This proposed document is fundamentally anti-trans and is completely misleading in its goals. Ostracizing and endangering trans students by outing them to their parents and peers does nothing to protect students, and punishing teachers for discussing preferred pronouns is inane, considering we all use them. As a former VA public school student, I feel that the fear of diversity and progressive ideology present in this guidance encourages a narrow world-view and misinformation far behind modern research about gender identity that could leave students less compassionate and less educated as they navigate life. This is an attack on trans students who deserve a supportive environment amongst their peers and educators at school, regardless of whether they have one at home. Transgender identity is not an ideology that one can subscribe to or reject, and denying a trans student's existence and bodily autonomy should not be considered protecting another's first amendment rights. Furthermore, any claims that this proposed guidance protects girls is completely disingenuous. These proposed guidance changes will guarantee material harms to the lives of trans and cisgender girls alike. ",137994,9/26/22  5:57pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=137994

This will absolutely result in increased stressors on a population that is already marginalized and struggling to fit in. This policy is telling these students that they are not acceptable as who they are.

Jeff Bloom ,"The Proposed Change Violates The Law, Is Not Based On Science, And Not Good For Students Or Parents","  The proposed changes to the Virginia state guidance on implementing the law passed by the Virginia legislature regarding transgender students in Virginia schools are illegal and immoral and should be rejected by the Governor and his administration.  One reason the proposed changes must be rejected is that they violate the provisions in the law that require state policy regarding transgender students to be based on the best available medical and scientific evidence, and also to be in the best interests of such students.  The proposed changes are not in accord with the evidence showing that what is best for transgender students is policy mandating practices by school administrators and staff that affirm the students’ gender identity.  The proposed policy and its required practices unlawfully attempt to shame such students on the basis of their gender identity and bully them into closeted submission by forcing them to live according to ignorant and false notions of their gender being in accord with their sex or the gender specified on their birth certificate, when that is not the case.     In addition, the proposed changes in the transgender student guidance policy also violate the Virginia constitution’s requirements for laws to be in the public interest, and for laws to be non-sectarian.  The proposed changes are not in the interest of the trans students attending Virginia schools, as explained above, and they are therefore also not in the interest of the students’ parents and families.  The proposed changes are also sectarian in that they are being promoted and justified in many cases on the alleged basis of religious beliefs – even though no religion on earth requires these policies to be imposed on students and their families.  To the extent that the proposed policy changes are being promoted on the basis of a religious agenda, the proposed changes violate the religious freedom and constitutional rights of the trans students and their families, who do not share the religious views of the proponents of the proposed changes.     The students who attend schools with transgender students are not demanding the proposed changes in state policy and practices – it is adults who seem to be obsessed with the sexuality and gender identity of other people who are calling for these changes.  The children are not similarly obsessed and frightened by attending school with transgender students – it is their parents who are having problems dealing with the reality that gender dysphoria is a real medical condition that results in the gender identify of some students not matching their sex characteristics or the gender listed on their birth certificate.      The law and guidance policy in place now were developed in direct consultation with the parents of students in Virginia’s schools, contrary to the official description of the proposed changes in policy.  They also were developed in accordance with the latest scientific and medical information regarding what is best for transgender students and the student body as a whole.  The current law and policy in effect now have no effect on the religious beliefs and practices of parents or students, contrary to the assertion in the official description of the proposed changes – except that they allow all students to be treated the same way, even when they are transgender.  That honors the religious beliefs of all students, and treats them all equally.     Accordingly, it would be better for Virginia students and for their families if the Governor and the other people who are so obsessed about other people’s sexuality and gender identity address their irrational anxieties in a more constructive way and stop bullying transgender students and their families.  I urge the Governor and the state to keep the state guidance on transgender students as it is, acknowledge and respect the purposes and science-based facts behind the law on transgender students enacted by the Virginia legislature, and dispose of this ill-conceived, illegal, and immoral proposal to change state policy.",138046,9/26/22  6:00pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138046

Gloria ,YES: Include Parents: Stable Children and Families Are a Threat to Cultural Marxism,"Parents must be notified of behavior aberrant to a child's sex at birth, so they can choose a mental health professional to intervene. The American College of Pediatrics urges educators, legislators, and healthcare professionals to create policies based on the reality of a child's biological sex by birth: base decisions on facts, not feelings.  Stable children and parents are a threat to cultural Marxism whose aim is - and always has been - to confuse and thereby create compliant slaves of the state.   https://acpeds.org/assets/imported/9.14.17-Gender-Ideology-Harms-Children_updated-MC.pdf",,9/26/22  6:01pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138079

Anonymous ,Support Youngkin,"I fully support Governor Youngkin. Transgender students NEED the help of their parents. They do not need to be further secretive about their identity crisis. Childten’s brains are not fully developed so why would any responsible adult allow a child to make a change as drastic as trying to switch genders or wanting to dabble in using new pronouns?  How does being secretive benefit anyone? Being secretive is what people do when they’re being DECEITFUL. When we are honest, there’s no reason for secrets. I believe it is immoral for school systems to support holding crucial information from students’ parents or guardians. I’d also like to say that female students should not have to share their bathroom or locker room with anyone except other females. How about if we focus on THAT? How is it fair for girls to have biological males in their bathroom or locker room? Governor, please be strong in your convictions. I am neither religious nor a strong right or left leaner. I am, however, intelligent and a strong proponent of mental health care. If children and their parents have such poor relationships that they cannot discuss a child wanting to change genders, they clearly need family and individual counseling so they can openly, not deceitfully, figure out the root of the problem and devise a solution for when the child becomes an adult. Thank you for considering my stance on this topic. ",138081,9/26/22  6:02pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138081

Dalton H ,"Strongly opposed, protect trans students","I can't help but notice that ""parents' rights"" seems to mean rights for the parents who share the governor's viewpoints and not so many rights for those that don't, not to mention that this form of all-encompassing focus on parents completely ignores the rights of the students themselves. Cries of ""protect our children"" appear to either mean protect them from transgender students (obviously offensive) or protect them from whatever is ""turning them transgender"" (still offensive, but even dumber). The governor himself said he dislikes how schools need permission to give aspirin, but can help children make these ""decisions"" with impunity; ie. he believes transgenderism to be a choice, one that parents should be making. Except no matter a parent's stance on gender, them not approving isn't going to change anything; people, even young ones, are who they are. The overall message is that this sort of identity isn't valid and it's not going to be accepted, regardless of any pretty words about not tolerating bullying.",138084,9/26/22  6:02pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138084

"William K. Cody, RN, PhD, FAAN Retired Nursing Professor & Dean ",This policy is abusive & will result in trans kids' deaths,"This document as written is nothing but a transparent attempt to allow ultra-conservative, anti-LGBTQ persons (here called parents, but public schools are EVERYBODY's responsibility) to dominate school policies around LGBTQ issues, particularly treatment of trans or gender-diverse children & teens. Trans persons are a small minority. They are NOT in any way inherently disruptive to society. Anti-trans reactions are obviously plainly MORE disruptive than the existence & presence of trans persons in the first place. Trans and gender-diverse children and teens, although few in number, deserve to be treated with the same full measure of human dignity, respect, courtesy, freedom, & safety, as every other student. This document as written clearly makes that quite IMPOSSIBLE. The document seems to assume that all children start out as cisgender (due to conservative societal/parental ASSUMPTIONS only) and somehow at some time slowly begin to have ideas about transitioning, often by hearing about the possibility of transitioning. This NOT the narrative that actual trans persons have told us for decades. Trans kids with NO exposure to transness often tell their parents, not that they ""want"" to be a different gender, but that they simply ARE. Generally, social transition measures like change of name, pronouns, and clothing, and sometimes restroom/changing room (altho there can certainly be gender-neutral private spaces, too) are the ONLY affirmation available to minors. These are totally benign and modest measures that hurt no one. Studies have shown these simple measures reduce anxiety and depression and increase self-reported happiness among gender-diverse kids. This document basically outlaws these simple practices and also requires surveillance and reporting of gender-diverse kids to parents who may be disapproving, strict disciplinarians, abusive, including physical abuse, and possibly gravely dangerous to their children. This is a document rooted not in safeguarding but in hatred for difference; hatred for a small and nearly-helpless minority; & actual hatred for young people, ages 5 to 18, who experience their gender differently from the majority. Most mental health professionals consider so-called ""conversion therapy"" essentially a form of torture. This policy, if adopted, is basically forcing a form of conversion therapy on every trans or gender-diverse kid in Virginia schools all day, everyday, throughout K thru 12. This will lead to extreme mental health disasters among these students, very likely increased suicides, and (quite seriously) potentially homicides committed by parents. Please take this cautionary advice very seriously. This is an extremely regressive policy that should absolutely not be adopted. ",138112,9/26/22  6:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138112

"Mary DeMarco Roland, retired FCPS educator ",According to Maslow’s Hierarchy  of needs,"According to educational psychology, children need to feel safe in order to thrive in an educational setting. The small percentage of young people struggling with their identity can be found in grades 7-12.  Sexuality and gender identity are just part of the many things kids struggle with.  During this struggle, family members, teachers, coaches, religious leaders etc. are the spokes of the wheel that have always been there to support children through their lives.  How disappointing, painful, damaging it is to have any of those important people not only stop supporting kids but in some cases, make the young person feel wrong, unloveable, shameful and not worthy.  These are the messages we send kids when we don’t support them in a psychologically safe and accepting environment.  No funds are needed to make these kids feel safe.  There are usually one or two staff bathrooms available in the counseling office or administrative offices at any school.  If one of those bathrooms could be used for kids who are transgender or transitioning to transgender, then they would have a safe place to use the restroom.  In addition, these kids would pass by the those adults most committed to their safety every day.  If you don’t have a single peer in the school accepting you, yet the principal and counselors say hello with a smile everyday, chances are you are going to much better off than having to use the restroom elsewhere! On the other side of the argument is the kids who fall in to the norm.  People always ask,      ‘ What about their safety and comfort?’ Their bathrooms would be the mens room or the ladies room, as it is in most public places.   Here’s the thing.  These identified by gender bathrooms have always been a place where bullying could take place.  No adult supervises these spaces.  So, using my own argument, that kids need to feel both psychologically and physically safe in order to learn and thrive, would it also be a good idea to make separate restroom areas for them in the office spaces of the counselors or administrators ?  We could continue this logic until we have entire office paces filled with special bathrooms. Two things come to mind.  Better education regarding acceptance of all students and a zero bullying tolerance policy which would result in expulsion not just suspension.  The bystanders that could have stopped the bullying would be suspended for supporting the bully.  You probably think this is crazy; where does it end?  This is what school leaders have been working on for years.  The general public just heard about accommodating gender safe bathrooms two years ago.  In the education world, we have been protecting kids, all kinds of kids since the at least 1943!  We just didn’t make a law out of it. Here’s the final fact:  kids who do not feel loved, supported and accepted are at a greater risk of using drugs and/ or committing suicide.  Kids that are transgender are more likely to go straight to suicide.  The utter confusion, abandonment, isolation, double life they try to live to make others feel better puts them at risk for holding in so much pain, that leaving this earth seems not only an option but a gift to all those who used to love them unconditionally parents, family members..the rest of the list from above.   Please, Virginia, it is hard enough to be a kid , a pre-teen, teenager today as it is.  Can we please make our schools just a little safer by allowing a safe haven to those who need it most.  ",138114,9/26/22  6:03pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138114

Brandon Rollo ,Public Servants,"My initial comment is in relation to a teacher’s first amendment right to protect their religious beliefs. Teachers are public servants - they serve all members of a community, not themselves. We cannot have police or firefighters choose not to serve community members due to prejudice, just as we cannot have teachers choose not to serve community members due to prejudice.  I believe respecting a student’s identity is serving that student and the community as a whole. Schools, where students interact with their peers on a daily basis, can act as a safe haven for students who are unable to explore their identity at home. Amidst peer groups at school, students learn to navigate the disparate identities of other individuals just as they will have to when their education is complete.  The proposed guidelines attempt to shelter some students from encountering diverse identities, at the expense of other students’ ability to express those identities. Both students exploring their identities and those in their peer groups learn these identities are meant to be shunned, not embraced. Shunned identities are detrimental to individuals and the community as a whole. Individuals who cannot feel comfortable being themselves will not become actualized, fully productive members of society. Communities which reject other viewpoints with prejudice stagnate, and limit themselves from experiencing the vibrant and unique ideas of every individual. ",138180,9/26/22  6:07pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138180

Emily Morrison ,The strongest possible opposition,"Virginia’s new “model policies” for K-12 public schools related to trans, non-binary, gender fluid, gender-questioning, and otherwise non-cisgendered students, are deeply flawed, harmful, and wrong. The policies are masked as “parent rights” policies. But really they force schools to “out” children who may not feel safe revealing their identities at home. The policies also clearly try to limit who is afforded equal rights and protections in school (by creating strict definitions of who can be considered trans or non-binary and whether their parents “approve”). Gender (or any other element of identity) is not up to the state to define, limit, or control, and it should not affect a child’s access to safe public education. One egregious aspect is a section stating that school counselors will have to tell parents if students come to their offices to discuss “issues related to gender.” Sadly, many children who are not cisgender or who do not fall within the gender binary are not supported at home may be literally in physical danger at home for expressing themselves authentically. Forcing school personnel to “out” children may end in irrevocable harm to children. All in all, these proposed school policies provide less ability for kids to be themselves safely in school.

Robert Gorman ,Model Policies for the Treatment of Transgender Students in Virginia’s Public Schools I approve.,"I strongly agree with the new & improved Model Policies for our children.  When my son was in the Arlington County Schools, he received such a great education, we were so pleased.  He went on to being a fine, highly educated man.  He is a model for his wonderful children.  I worked every year at the Science Fair at HB & W& L even after he graduated and was impressed with the quality of the education these children received.  The children amazed me as to their enthusiasm for learning & the teachers were outstanding.  Yes, there was some bullying.  When my son was young he was bullied, but each child offender was disciplined & parents counseled their children as to what effective actions could be taken to protect themselves from their attackers.  Now our Arlington County schools are teaching kindergarten students about sex & sex differences.  Most children do not understand the adult jargon & adult problems presented to them.  When schools talked about providing sex education to our children, though it is a parents job, we were hoping they would only teach children who were ready for puberty & mature enough to understand human feelings & supplement what we taught him . Now I do not know what parents think, but their children's education has been damaged. I most certainly agree we must go back to the way it was.  I want to be proud of Arlington again.  Unfortunately, if I had a child in these schools today I would immediately take my son out.  My son was the most important job of my live & I proudly can say I provided education at home, moral integrity & love, which I believed was also taught in our Arlington County Schools at that time.  Thank you Mrs. Hoo & Mrs. Mountain.  Both of you were fantastic teachers.",138191,9/26/22  6:08pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138191

How can you possibly justify these policies that literally isolate and further alienate children? Just let people be who they feel they are. It takes no effort on the part of outsiders. If you don't like it, simply ignore it. Allowing others to enjoy the same rights that you have always had costs you nothing. It does not diminish your own rights, nor does it encourage anyone to be anything beyond what they already are. What it does do, is save lives.

Anonymous ,2022 Model Draft Policies,"As a student, these draft model policies make me concerned for the health and safety of my LGBTQ+ friends. These model policies directly endanger the lives of transgender students by making school into a hostile environment, when school should be a safe and welcoming place for all students, especially Queer students. We all just want to learn in a safe environment, but this attack on LGBTQ+ students’ rights renders us unable to do so. These policies are a direct contrast to the statement made by the VDOE itself, “All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students.” These policies are disgusting and an attack on LGBTQ+ students that lack “compassion and respect” for their wellbeing. ",138227,9/26/22  6:09pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138227

It adds inane bureaucratic barriers that will  endanger any trans kids whose parents are unsupportive. This policy is an attack on trans people but it is also a policy that is rooted in ideas that marginalized people deserve to be marginalized, that certain groups are not allowed to be free or autonomous, that other people know us better than we do ourselves.

Lee Walzer (Parent) ,The proposed guidance is both illegal and morally offensive,"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on Governor Youngkin's and Secretary Guidera's proposed guidance on transgender students.  I am doing so as the parent of a former student in Virginia public schools.  First, the guidance violates both existing Virginia and federal law.  The US Department of Education has held that Title IX protects transgender students.  Moreover, the Supreme Court held in Bostock v. Clayton County that transgender employees are protected from discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964's prohibition of discrimination based on sex.  Consequently, the trend in federal law is squarely in favor of the protection of transgender students.  Moreover, Virginia law also protects trans students, the Governor's attempted flouting of that law notwithstanding.  This guidance will in due course be declared unconstitutional - after the Governor and Education Secretary have spent thousands of dollars in legal fees on this stunt. More broadly, this policy does nothing to protect the rights of parents who seek to care for their children based on longstanding medical and psychological standards of care for trans youth.  The Governor and Secretary Guidera are only interested in protecting the views of parents who think like them.  There are millions of Virginia parents with very different views on transgender students.  Many of us base our views not only on science (which the Governor and Secretary are ignoring) but also our faith tradition. I belong to Temple Rodef Shalom in Falls Church.  It is one of the largest, if not the largest, synagogues in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Our rabbi spoke out eloquently against this proposed guidance, which is diametrically opposed to what Judaism teaches on transgender people, during Rosh Hashanah services last night.  I object to the Governor and Education Secretary injecting their personal bigotry and/or narrow and exclusionary religious beliefs into Virginia schools and forcing them on students and parents with different religious beliefs.  This is a de facto effort to privilege conservative Christian doctrine over other religions and their teachings. This proposed guidance harms, as I noted above, the ability of Virginia parents to provide for the upbringing of their children by subjecting the trans children of Virginia parents to discrimination and harm at the hands of state employees on the direct order of the Governor and Education Secretary.  If implemented, it will subject trans students to mistreatment at the hands of teachers and fellow students.  That is not a welcoming, safe environment, which the proposed Guidance purports to uphold.  The proposed Guidance also subjects trans students who may be exploring who they are and do not feel they can confide in their parents to potential harm by mandating that teachers and other school staff out them against their will to their parents.  It turns school employees into the type of informants that we decry in fascist and totalitarian regimes around the world.  These students have a right to be who they are - whoever that may be -- without schools forcibly telling on them and subjecting them to harm at home. Finally, the proposed Guidance defies common sense.  I attended public school (outside of Virginia) from the late 1960s until 1981.  In my years of schooling, I saw classmates request that teachers call them by a name other than their legal name and teachers always accepted the request.  Because they wanted to create a warm atmosphere in their classroom by accepting students as they were.  The proposed Guidance will empower teachers with religious beliefs very different from mine to use those beliefs as justification for mistreating students in their care.  That is the polar opposite of what education is supposed to be about. This proposed Guidance should be withdrawn and former Governor Northam's guidance restored.  If the Governor persists in this stubborn attempt to impose his narrow sectarian agenda to bully an already vulnerable minority, I have no doubt that the Governor will be put in his place by the Judiciary and will celebrate when that happens.

Aiden Ball ,I OPPOSE THIS,"Every day, throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia, educators and school leaders work to ensure that all students have an opportunity to receive a high-quality education. As a part of that work, educators strive to meet the individual needs of all students entrusted to their care, and teachers work to create educational environments where all students thrive. The Virginia Department of Education (the “Department”) recognizes that each child is a unique individual with distinctive abilities and characteristics that should be valued and respected. All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students. The Department also fully acknowledges the rights of parents to exercise their fundamental rights granted by the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to direct the care, upbringing, and education of their children. The Code of Virginia reaffirms the rights of parents to determine how their children will be raised and educated. Empowering parents is not only a fundamental right, but it is essential to improving outcomes for all children in Virginia. The Department is mindful of constitutional protections that prohibit governmental entities from requiring individuals to adhere to or adopt a particular ideological belief. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees religious freedom and prohibits the government from compelling speech that is contrary to an individual’s personal or religious beliefs. The Department embarked on a thorough review of the Model Policies Guidance adopted on March 4, 2021 (the “2021 Model Policies”). The 2021 Model Policies promoted a specific viewpoint aimed at achieving cultural and social transformation in schools. The 2021 Model Policies also disregarded the rights of parents and ignored other legal and constitutional principles that significantly impact how schools educate students, including transgender students. With the publication of these 2022 Model Policies (the “2022 Model Policies”), the Department hereby withdraws the 2021 Model Policies, which shall have no further force and effect. The Department issues the 2022 Model Policies to provide clear, accurate, and useful guidance to Virginia school boards that align with statutory provisions governing the Model Policies. See Code of Virginia, § 22.1-23.3 (the “Act”). Significantly, the 2022 Model Policies also consider over 9,000 comments submitted to the Department during the public comment period for the 2021 Model Policies.",138268,9/26/22  6:12pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138268

Laura ,"Separating sports by sex is fine, but let students dress and act in gender other non-confirming ways","Schools should allow students to dress and act in ways typical of the male or female gender regardless of their sex, and allow students to engage in activities regardless of whether they are XX or XY at the cellular level. The top requirement is to prevent students from being harassed based on how they dress, whether they feel they are a gender other than the sex they were born with, or act according to their view of their gender. Clothes, acting ""masculine"" or ""feminine,"" does not matter. Students having good self esteem matters.  Having XX or XY chromosomes affects things like your skeletal structure that cannot be changed by hormone therapy or surgery. In some sports, XX people have a physical advantage.  In some sports, XY people have a physical advantage. That is why it is reasonable for some sports to separate XX and XY people. It is also reasonable to have bathrooms for XX people separate from bathrooms for XY people, but it is necessary to provide unisex bathrooms accessible for students who feel their gender does not match their sex given the top requirement to protect all students from harassment. If a student feels their gender differs from their sex, parents should be consulted so that they and the school can best meet the needs of the students. If the parents want to student to dress and act according to their XX or XY chromosomes, the student should be given counseling to help them cope with their need to accept the parent's decision until they are legally old enough to make their own decisions.",138278,9/26/22  6:12pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138278

Anonymous ,This Is Dangerous -- Transgender Students Need Trusted Faculty,"While all of these model policies will have disastrous effects on the mental well-being of transgender students across the commonwealth for a number of reasons, I will be highlighting just one today by using a personal anecdote. Back in 2017, I was a closeted gay student at my high school. Dealing with unrequited feelings toward my best friend at the time and a family that sees homosexuality as a sin, I was in desperate need of a trusted adult that I could go to--in confidence--about my then-current situation. I was terrified, depressed, and extremely anxious about my place in a conservative town with a conservative family that may retaliate if they knew about my homosexuality. I built up the confidence over weeks to meet with my guidance counselor and explain to her my feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and condemnation. My life at that point in time had felt like a never-ending nightmare, one in which I woke up each day with the burden of homophobia in my environment, thinking to myself that this couldn't truly be my life, that this was the sort of thing that only happened in the movies. My guidance counselor, in her capacity, served as a trusted adult at the time that I could rely on to divulge the ins and outs of my current situation with the hopes of relieving the overwhelming sense of abandonment and helplessness that permeated my daily life. She made very clear to me in that meeting that she would not share with my parents my homosexuality--a promise that she ultimately kept--in order to ensure my safety.  Under Governor Glenn Youngkin's model policies on the treatment of transgender students, closeted, terrified students much like myself would not have the ability to enjoy the same confidentiality with their school counselor. Youngkin's current model policies would require school staff to out students to their parents in some circumstances, such as when a student sees a counselor. In my personal experience, when grappling with my own sexuality in the shadow of an evangelical christian nuclear family, that confidential meeting with my school counselor in high school served a paramount purpose in my own mental wellbeing, one that allowed me to--if only for a second--feel as if I were not alone in the world, with a trusted adult that could hear and respond to my concerns. Being closeted for four years of my life due to fear of retaliation from my parents left an everlasting scar on my mental health, self-confidence, and formation of relationships going forward. To this day, I still have a broken relationship with my parents and find it extremely difficult to travel back home for the holidays, but having the ability to speak with my high school counselor in confidence was a crucial piece of the puzzle in me learning to love myself for who I am, overcoming the fear of retaliation and judgement, and healing from the trauma of unrequited love and condemnation. My honest and singular hope is that transgender students in the commonwealth of Virginia will continue to have that same level of acceptance and confidentiality that saved me in the darkest period of my life. ",138284,9/26/22  6:12pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138284

Rosemary Gould ,I am strongly opposed to this harmful change.,"In my community, trans and nonbinary students have just begun in the last few years to come out in school.

Government policies need to be fair and equitable to all but cannot impinge on the majority in order to protect or favor a minority.

That is what is both hostile and dangerous.

It is absolutely certain that if this passes, depression and anxiety rates in school kids will sky rocket. These policies should aim to PROTECT everyone, like the current policy does, instead of aim to separate and cause harm to children who's parents think they know more about their child than the child (who is their own person) knows about themselves. No trans children are trying to abuse or harass your cis kids (non trans); trans people, especially trans girls/women, are incredibly likely to be harassed, raped, and even killed solely for the fact of them being trans.

They should not be subjected to discriminatory “dead naming”.   I  do allow that the current bathroom /locker room policies need revision as all children should feel safe and comfortable in these facilities.  Given the sensitivity of these concerns and the relatively small numbers of students needing accommodation, could schools mot have the leeway to determine a safe solution for all students? For example a staff bathroom might be made available to a student for a private changing area?  Seems like a common sense best practice to me.

You cannot force someone to use a specific bathroom, you cannot force teachers to out their trans students, and you can't force them to address them by specific names. These policies will do nothing but contribute harm to trans students who already have it difficult in many aspects of their lives. Schools are supposed to be a safe place for them and this will cause them to fall back academically, intentionally miss school, or other situations that will result from them not feeling safe there. This policy is only being passed to promote the Governor's anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and forcibly indoctrinate it on young kids in schools. Whether or not this goes through there will be people who simply do not follow it because it is wrong and there are educators out there who will not allow this to be on their conscience. Many of my friends are transgender students who have stated that if these policies were in force when they were in school they may have turned to suicide or self harm.

These policies are a direct contrast to the statement made by the VDOE itself, “All students have the right to attend school in an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or bullying. The Department supports efforts to protect and encourage respect for all students. Thus, we have a collective responsibility to address topics such as the treatment of transgender students with necessary compassion and respect for all students.” These policies are disgusting and an attack on LGBTQ+ students that lack “compassion and respect” for their wellbeing. ",138366,9/26/22  6:16pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138366

Ken McReynolds ,Totally opposed to this hateful policy.,This is just another example of our Governor's hateful policies towards the LGBTQ communities. This will cause undue harm to transgender youth. These children have rights! Suicide rates may increase. Lawsuits will follow any implementation. Work on the real problems facing our society instead of fighting fake culture wars.,138370,9/26/22  6:16pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138370
Angad Kaur ,Trans rights are human rights,"Referring to Governor Youngkin’s 2022 proposed model policy: The governor’s policy is rooted in transphobia, violates human rights and rights to privacy among some of our most vulnerable children. It prohibits teacher and staff from supporting trans and non-binary students. It creates a culture of fear, making it difficult for students to focus on learning, which is the opposite of what schools should be doing.  The American Pediatric Association explicitly supports gender affirming care for trans and non-binary children. So this proposal goes against expert medical research and opinion.  The American Psychology Association cites research, documenting extensive experiences of stigma and discrimination reported by trans and non-binary people and the mental health consequences of these experiences, including increased rates of depression and suicidality.     ",138371,9/26/22  6:17pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138371

Anonymous ,New Transgender rules are good,"The majority of kids in Virginia are not transgender. Why should they be treated so special. Teachers should teach reading, writing and arithmetic!!  Leave the social and personal issues to the parents! Don't want my kid in the bathroom with a kid that is not the same sex. I hate to break it to you but you ARE A BOY or GIRL!!!",138377,9/26/22  6:17pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138377

Kat ,Completely oppose,"As a recent (trans) graduate of Virginia public schools, this proposal is awful. Gender is a complicated, personal situation. We don't let parents tell their children exactly who they have to be-- parents cannot dictate everything about their children, because children are people trying their best, their hardest, to figure out the world. As a transgender person, part of figuring out that is having spaces where you feel safe experimenting and asserting your identity, where you can stop lying to protect yourself and find out what you actually think and feel. I had the really lucky chance to have my school be that place. I didn't have to make any permanent decisions or come out to everyone in my entire life. I could find my own subtleties. Many of my school staff supported me through this or made it a non issue, and I've seen how valuable this is for other kids. Schools are the place where children become community members. This sort of policy creates an environment that is really stressful, scary, and pervasive for a whole lot of people.",138381,9/26/22  6:17pm,https://townhall.virginia.gov/ViewComments.cfm?commentid=138381
